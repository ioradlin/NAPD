There\nhave also been many requests from my patients and from members of the\nmedical and dental professions for concise statements as to what I have\nfound that would be useful as preventive procedures. In addition I have\nbeen conscious of an opportunity for helpfulness to the members of the\nvarious primitive races that I have studied and who are so rapidly\ndeclining in health and numbers at their point of contact with our\nmodern civilization. Since they have so much accumulated wisdom that is\npassing with them, it has seemed important that the elements in the\nmodern contacts that are so destructive to them should be discovered\nand removed.There has been a deep sense of obligation to the officials of\nmany countries for the great kindness and assistance that they have so\ncheerfully given by providing the opportunity for these investigations.\nThe list of these individuals is much too long to mention them all by\nname. One of the joys of my work has been the privilege of knowing the\nmagnificent characters that are at the outposts earnestly striving to\nbetter the welfare of the natives whom they are ministering to, but who\nare distraught with the recognition that under the modernization\nprogram the natives decline in health and become afflicted by our\nmodern types of degenerative diseases. It would be fortunate if each of\nthese field workers could be provided with a copy of this report which\nthey have helped to make possible.In order to make this information available to as wide a group\nas possible, I have avoided technical language and will ask the\nindulgence of professional readers.There are some individuals whose assistance I must acknowledge\nspecifically: Reverend Father John Siegen and Doctor Alfred Gysi of\nSwitzerland; Mrs. Lulu Herron and Doctor J.

PRICE8926 Euclid Avenue,Cleveland, Ohio, 1938.TABLE OF CONTENTSINTRODUCTIONTHIS text provides a new approach to some\nproblems of modern degeneration. Instead of the customary procedure of\nanalyzing the expressions of degeneration, a search has been made for\ngroups to be used as controls who are largely free from these\naffections.After spending several years approaching this problem by both\nclinical and laboratory research methods, I interpreted the\naccumulating evidence as strongly indicating the absence of some\nessential factors from our modern program, rather than the presence of\ninjurious factors. This immediately indicated the need for obtaining\ncontrols. To accomplish this it became necessary to locate immune\ngroups which were found readily as isolated remnants of primitive\nracial stocks in different parts of the world. A critical examination\nof these groups revealed a high immunity to many of our serious\naffections so long as they were sufficiently isolated from our modern\ncivilization and living in accordance with the nutritional programs\nwhich were directed by the accumulated wisdom of the group. In every\ninstance where individuals of the same racial stocks who had lost this\nisolation and who had adopted the foods and food habits of our modern\ncivilization were examined, there was an early loss of the high\nimmunity characteristics of the isolated group. These studies have\nincluded a chemical analysis of foods of the isolated groups and also\nof the displacing foods of our modern civilization.These investigations have been made among the following\nprimitive racial stocks including both isolated and modernized groups:\nthe Swiss of Switzerland, the Gaelics in the Outer and Inner Hebrides,\nthe Eskimos of Alaska, the Indians in the far North, West and Central\nCanada, Western United States and Florida, the Melanesians and\nPolynesians on eight archipelagos of the Southern Pacific, tribes in\neastern and central Africa, the Aborigines of Australia, Malay tribes\non islands north of Australia, the Maori of New Zealand and the ancient\ncivilizations and their descendants in Peru both along the coast and in\nthe Sierras, also in the Amazon Basin. Where available the modernized\nwhites in these communities also were studied. There have been many\nimportant unexpected developments in these investigations. While a\nprimary quest was to find the cause of tooth decay which was\nestablished quite readily as being controlled directly by nutrition, it\nrapidly became apparent that a chain of disturbances developed in these\nvarious primitive racial stocks starting even in the first generation\nafter the adoption of the modernized diet and rapidly increased in\nseverity with expressions quite constantly like the characteristic\ndegenerative processes of our modern civilization of America and\nEurope. While tooth decay has proved to be almost entirely a matter of\nthe nutrition of the individual at the time and prior to the activity\nof that disease, a group of affections have expressed themselves in\nphysical form. These have included facial and dental arch changes\nwhich, heretofore, have been accounted for as results of admixtures of\ndifferent racial stocks. My investigations have revealed that these\nsame divergencies from normal are reproduced in all these various\nracial stocks while the blood is still pure. Indeed, these even develop\nin those children of the family that are born after the parents adopted\nthe modern nutrition.Applying these methods of study to our American families, we\nfind readily that a considerable percentage of our families show this\nsame deterioration in the younger members. The percentage of\nindividuals so affected in our American communities in which I have\nmade studies varies through a wide range, usually between 25 per cent\nto 75 per cent. A certain percentage of this affected group has not\nonly these evidences of physical injury, but also personality\ndisturbances, the most common of which is a lower than normal mental\nefficiency and acuteness, chiefly observed as so-called mental\nbackwardness which includes the group of children in the schools who\nare unable to keep up with their classmates. Their I.Q.'s are generally\nlower than normal and they readily develop inferiority complexes\ngrowing out of their handicap. From this group or parallel with it a\ncertain percentage develop personality disturbances which have their\nexpression largely in unsocial traits. They include the delinquents who\nat this time are causing so much trouble and concern because of\nevidence of increase in their numbers. This latter group has been\naccounted for largely on the basis of some conditioning experience that\ndeveloped after the child had reached an impressionable age. My\ninvestigations are revealing a physical structural change and\ntherefore, an organic factor which precedes and underlies these\nconditioning influences of the environment. The fact that a government\nsurvey has shown that 66 per cent of the delinquents who have been\ntreated in the best institutions and released as cured, later have\ndeveloped their unsocial or criminal tendencies, strongly emphasizes\nthe urgent necessity that if preventive methods are to be applied these\nmust precede and forestall the primary injuries themselves.While it has been known that certain injuries were directly\nrelated to an inadequate nutrition of the mother during the formative\nperiod of the child, my investigations are revealing evidence that the\nproblem goes back still further to defects in the germ plasms as\ncontributed by the two parents. These injuries, therefore, are related\ndirectly to the physical condition of one or of both of these\nindividuals prior to the time that conception took place.A very important phase of my investigations has been the\nobtaining of information from these various primitive racial groups\nindicating that they were conscious that such injuries would occur if\nthe parents were not in excellent physical condition and nourishment.\nIndeed, in many groups I found that the girls were not allowed to be\nmarried until after they had had a period of special feeding. In some\ntribes a six months period of special nutrition was required before\nmarriage. An examination of their foods has disclosed special\nnutritional factors which are utilized for this purpose.The scope of this work, accordingly, becomes of direct interest\nin many fields including the various branches of the healing arts,\nparticularly medicine and dentistry, and the social organizations that\nare concerned with betterment of the racial stock. Similarly, the\neducational groups are concerned directly since, if we are to stem the\ntide by passing new information on to the parents of the new\ngeneration, it must be done prior to the time the emergency shall\narise. This involves a system of education directed particularly to the\nhigh school age pupils.The data that are being presented in the following chapters\nsuggest the need for reorientation in many problems of our modern\nsocial organization. The forces involved in heredity have in general\nbeen deemed to be so powerful as to be able to resist all impacts and\nchanges in the environment. These data will indicate that much that we\nhave interpreted as being due to heredity is really the result of\nintercepted heredity. While great emphasis has been placed on the\ninfluence of the environment on the character of the individual, the\nbody pattern has generally been supposed to require a great number of\nimpacts of a similar nature to alter the design. The brain has been\nassumed to be similarly well organized in most individuals except that\nincidents in the life of the individual such as disappointments,\nfright, etc., are largely responsible for disturbed behavior. Normal\nbrain functioning has not been thought of as being as biologic as\ndigestion. The data provided in the succeeding chapters indicate that\nassociated with disturbances in the development of the bones of the\nhead, disturbances may at the same time occur in the development of the\nbrain. Such structural defects usually are not hereditary factors even\nthough they appear in other members of the family or parents. They are\nproducts of the environment rather than hereditary units transmitted\nfrom the ancestry.In the light of these data important new emphasis is placed on\nthe quality of the germ cells of the two parents as well as on the\nenvironment provided by the mother. The new evidence indicates that the\npaternal contribution may be an injured product and that the\nresponsibility for defective germ cells may have to be about equally\ndivided between the father and mother. The blending of races has been\nblamed for much of the distortion and defects in body form in our\nmodern generation. It will be seen that these face changes occur in all\nthe pure blood races studied in even the first generation, after the\nnutrition of the parents has been changed.The origin of personality and character appear in the light of\nthe newer data to be biologic products and to a much less degree than\nusually considered pure hereditary traits. Since these various factors\nare biologic, being directly related to both the nutrition of the\nparents and to the nutritional environment of the individuals in the\nformative and growth period any common contributing factor such as food\ndeficiencies due to soil depletion will be seen to produce degeneration\nof the masses of people due to a common cause. Mass behavior therefore,\nin this new light becomes the result of natural forces, the expression\nof which may not be modified by propaganda but will require correction\nat the source. Nature has been at this process of building human\ncultures through many millenniums and our culture has not only its own\nexperience to draw from but that of parallel races living today as well\nas those who lived in the past. This work, accordingly, includes data\nthat have been obtained from several of Nature's other biologic\nexperiments to throw light on the problems of our modern white\ncivilization.In presenting the evidence I am utilizing photographs very\nliberally. A good illustration is said to be equivalent to a thousand\nwords of text. This is in keeping too with the recent trend in\njournalism. The pictures are much more convincing than words can be,\nand since the text challenges many of the current theories, the most\nconclusive evidence available is essential.Owing to the many requests received for slides or the loan of my\nnegatives, provision is being made for supplying a limited number of\nslides of the illustrations in either black and white or in color.\nSlides of other subjects are available.TABLE OF CONTENTSChapter 1WHY SEEK WISDOM FROM PRIMITIVE\nPEOPLESSOME of the primitive races have avoided\ncertain of the life problems faced by modernized groups and the methods\nand knowledge used by the primitive peoples are available to assist\nmodernized individuals in solving their problems. Many primitive races\nhave made habitual use of certain preventive measures in meeting\ncrucial life problems.Search for controls among remnants of primitive racial stocks\nhas been resorted to as a result of failure to find them in our\nmodernized groups or to find the controlling factors by applying\nlaboratory methods to the affected clinical material. Only the\nprimitive groups have been able to provide adequate normal\ncontrols.In the following chapters, I have presented descriptions of\ncertain peoples and their environments in primitive state, and, for\ncomparative study, descriptions of members of the primitive tribes who\nhave been in contact with modernized white races. I have recorded the\neffects of that contact as expressed in physical and character changes,\nand have given a survey of the factors in the environment which have\nchanged. It has been necessary to study in this way a wide variety of\nprimitive groups and physical environments. It will, accordingly, be\nadvisable for the reader to keep in mind the comparative effects of\ndifferent altitudes, latitudes, temperatures and races, and to note the\nsimilarity of the reactions of these primitive groups when contact is\nmade with our modern civilization. The purpose is to glean data that\nwill be applicable for use in correcting certain tragic expressions of\nour modern degeneration, including tooth decay, general physical\ndegeneration, and facial and dental-arch deformities, and character\nchanges. These data will be useful in preventing race decay and\ndeformities, in establishing a higher resistance to infective diseases,\nand in reducing the number of prenatal deficiency injuries. These\nlatter include such expressions as mental deficiencies caused by brain\ndefects in the formative period, which result in mental disturbances\nranging from moderate backwardness to character abnormalities.The data presented show the level of susceptibility to dental\ncaries (tooth decay) in each isolated primitive group and, contrasted\nwith that, the level of susceptibility in the modernized natives of the\nsame stock. A résumé of the changes in the environment\nthat are associated with the changes in immunity and susceptibility\nwill be presented. These data reveal an average increase in\nsusceptibility of thirty-five fold. Similar contrasts are shown in\nrelation to the relative incidence of facial and dental arch\ndeformities among primitive natives and modernized natives.It will be easy for the reader to be prejudiced since many of\nthe applications suggested are not orthodox. I suggest that conclusions\nbe deferred until the new approach has been used to survey the physical\nand mental status of the reader's own family, of his brothers and\nsisters, of associated families, and finally, of the mass of people met\nin business and on the street. Almost everyone who studies the matter\nwill be surprised that such clear-cut evidence of a decline in modern\nreproductive efficiency could be all about us and not have been\npreviously noted and reviewed.It is important to preface the observations by constructing a\nmental pattern of physical excellence from the pictures of the various\nprimitive groups and, with this yardstick or standard of normalcy,\nobserve our modern patterns. Certain preconceived ideas may have to be\nmodified, as for example, that based on the belief that what we see is\ndue to heredity or that deformity is due to mixing of races. If so, why\nshould the last child in a large family generally suffer most, and\noften be different in facial form; or why should there be these changes\nin the later children, even in pure racial stocks, after the parents\nhave adopted our modern types of nutrition? Although the causes of\nphysical degeneration that can be seen easily have been hard to trace,\nthe defects in the development of the brain, which affect the mind and\ncharacter, are much more obscure, and the causes of mental degeneration\nare exceedingly difficult to trace. Much that formerly has been left to\nthe psychiatrist to explain is now rapidly shifting to the realm of the\nanatomist and physiologist.Those contributions of the past cultures which have blended\nagreeably into our modern experience have been accepted with too little\nquestioning. Much ancient wisdom, however, has been rejected because of\nprejudice against the wisdom of so-called savages. Some readers may\nexperience this reaction to the primitive wisdom recorded in these\nchapters.The writer is fully aware that his message is not orthodox; but\nsince our orthodox theories have not saved us we may have to readjust\nthem to bring them into harmony with Nature's laws. Nature must be\nobeyed, not orthodoxy. Apparently many primitive races have understood\nher language better than have our modernized groups. Even the primitive\nraces share our blights when they adopt our conception of nutrition.\nThe supporting evidence for this statement is voluminous and as much of\nit as space permits is included in this volume. The illustrative\nmaterial used is taken from the many thousands of my negatives which\nare available. Photographs alone can tell much of the story, and one\nillustration is said to be worth as much as one thousand words.Since the problem of applying the wisdom of the primitives to\nour modern needs concerns not only health workers and nutritionists,\nbut also educators and social workers, the data are presented without\ntechnical details.While many of the primitive races studied have continued to\nthrive on the same soil through thousands of years, our American human\nstock has declined rapidly within a few centuries, and in some\nlocalities within a few decades. In the regions in which degeneration\nhas taken place the animal stock has also declined. A decadent\nindividual cannot regenerate himself, although he can reduce the\nprogressive decadence in the next generation, or can vastly improve\nthat generation, by using the demonstrated wisdom of the primitive\nraces. No era in the long journey of mankind reveals in the skeletal\nremains such a terrible degeneration of teeth and bones as this brief\nmodern period records. Must Nature reject our vaunted culture and call\nback the more obedient primitives? The alternative seems to be a\ncomplete readjustment in accordance with the controlling forces of\nNature.Thinking is as biologic as is digestion, and brain embryonic\ndefects are as biologic as are club feet. Since both are readily\nproduced by lowered parental reproductive capacity, and since Nature in\nher large-scale human demonstration reveals that this is chiefly the\nresult of inadequate nutrition of the parents and too frequent or too\nprolonged child bearing, the way back is indicated. Like the successful\nprimitive racial stocks, we, too, can make, as a first requisite,\nprovision for adequate nutrition both for generation and growth, and\ncan make provision for the regulation of the overloads. We, like the\nsuccessful primitives, can establish programs of instruction for\ngrowing youth and acquaint it with Nature s requirements long before\nthe emergencies and stresses arise. This may require a large-scale\nprogram of home and classroom instruction, particularly for the high\nschool girls and boys. This would be in accordance with the practice of\nmany of the primitive races reported upon in the following\nchapters.If the individuals in our modern society who are sufficiently\ndefective to require some supervision are in part or largely the\nproduct of an injured parentage, who should be held responsible? Is it\njust for society to consign these unsocial individuals which it has\nmade to a life of hard labor or confinement in depressing environments?\nIs it just for society to permit production of physical and mental\ncripples? Many primitive races apparently have prevented the\ndistortions which find expressions in unsocial acts. If so, cannot\nmodern society do this by studying and adopting the programs developed\nthrough centuries of experience by the primitives? Nature uses a\nwritten language which, without the keys, is made up of meaningless\nhieroglyphics, but which, with the proper keys, becomes a clear story\nof racial and individual history. The hieroglyphics indicate racial and\nindividual disaster for modernized groups who heed not the warning\nstory. The primitive races have some of these keys and have used them\nsuccessfully in avoiding many of the disasters of our modern society.\nThe following chapters record many of the excellent practices of the\nprimitives and they are presented here with the hope that they will be\nhelpful in a program designed to relieve mankind of some of the\nmisfortunes common in the present social order and to prevent disorders\nfor future generations of civilized peoples.TABLE OF CONTENTSChapter 2THE PROGRESSIVE DECLINE OF MODERN\nCIVILIZATIONTHAT modern man is declining in physical\nfitness has been emphasized by many eminent sociologists and other\nscientists. That the rate of degeneration is progressively accelerating\nconstitutes a cause for great alarm, particularly since this is taking\nplace in spite of the advance that is being made in modern science\nalong many lines of investigation.Dr. Alexis Carrel in his treatise \"Man, the Unknown\" states:Medicine is far from having decreased human\nsufferings as much as it endeavors to make us believe. Indeed, the\nnumber of deaths from infectious diseases has greatly diminished. But\nwe still must die in a much larger proportion from degenerative\ndiseases.After reviewing the reduction in the epidemic infectious diseases he\ncontinues as follows:All diseases of bacterial origin have decreased\nin a striking manner. . . . Nevertheless, in spite of the triumphs of\nmedical science, the problem of disease is far from solved. Modern man\nis delicate. Eleven hundred thousand persons have to attend the medical\nneeds of 120,000,000 other persons. Every year, among this population\nof the United States, there are about 100,000,000 illnesses, serious or\nslight. In the hospitals, 700,000 beds are occupied every day of the\nyear. . . . Medical care, under all its forms, costs about\n$3,500,000,000 yearly. . . . The organism seems to have become more\nsusceptible to degenerative diseases.The present health condition in the United States is reported\nfrom time to time by several agencies representing special phases of\nthe health program. The general health problem has been thoroughly\nsurveyed and interpreted by the Surgeon General of the United States\nPublic Health Service, Dr. Parran. Probably no one is so well informed\nin all of the phases of health as is the head of this important\ndepartment of the government. In his recent preliminary report(1)to state and local officers for their information\nand guidance, he presented data that have been gathered by a large\ngroup of government workers. The report includes a census of the health\nconditions of all the groups constituting the population of the United\nStates--records of the health status and of the economic status of\n2,660,000 individuals living in various sections, in various types of\ncommunities, on various economic levels. The data include records on\nevery age-group. He makes the following interpretations based upon the\nassumption that the 2,660,000 offer a fair sampling of the population,\nand he indicates the conclusions which may be drawn regarding\nconditions of status for the total population of some 130,000,000\npeople.Every day one out of twenty people is too sick\nto go to school or work, or attend his customary activities.Every man, woman and child (on the average) in\nthe nation suffers ten days of incapacity annually.The average youngster is sick in bed seven days\nof the year, the average oldster 35 days.Two million five hundred thousand people (42 per\ncent of the 6,000,000 sick every day) suffer from chronic\ndiseases-heart disease, hardening of the arteries, rheumatism, and\nnervous diseases.Sixty-five thousand people are totally deaf;\n75,000 more are deaf and dumb; 200,000 lack a hand, arm, foot or leg;\n300,000 have permanent spinal injuries; 500,000 are blind; 1,000,000\nmore are permanent cripples.Two persons on the Relief income level (less\nthan $1,000 yearly income for the entire family) are disabled for one\nweek or longer for every one person better off economically.Only one in 250 family heads in the income group\nof more than $2,000 yearly cannot seek work because of chronic\ndisability. In Relief families one in every 20 family heads is\ndisabled.Relief and low-income families are sick longer\nas well as more often than better-financed families. They call doctors\nless often. But the poor, especially in big cities, get to stay in\nhospitals longer than their better-off neighbors.Concluded Dr. Parran:It is apparent that inadequate diet, poor\nhousing, the hazards of occupation and the instability of the labor\nmarket definitely create immediate health problems.It will be seen from this report that the group expressed as\noldsters, who spend on an average thirty-five days per year in bed, are\nsick in bed one-tenth of the time. Those of us who are well, who may\nhave been so fortunate as to spend very little time in bed, will\ncontemplate this fact with considerable concern since it expresses a\nvast amount of suffering and enforced idleness. It is clear that so\ngreat an incidence of morbidity must place a heavy load upon those who\nat the time are well. The problem of the progressive increase in\npercentage of individuals affected with heart disease and cancer is\nadequate cause for alarm. Statistics have been published by the\nDepartment of Public Health in New York City which show the increase in\nthe incidence of heart disease to have progressed steadily during the\nyears from 1907 to 1936. The figures provided in their report reveal an\nincrease from 203.7 deaths per 100,000 in 1907 to 327.2 per 100,000 in\n1936. This constitutes an increase of 60 per cent. Cancer increased 90\nper cent from 1907 to 1936.That this problem of serious degeneration of our modern\ncivilization is not limited to the people of the United States has been\ncommented on at length by workers in many countries. Sir Arbuthnot\nLane, one of England's distinguished surgeons, and a student of public\nwelfare, has made this comment:(2)Long surgical experience has proved to me\nconclusively that there is something radically and fundamentally wrong\nwith the civilized mode of life, and I believe that unless the present\ndietetic and health customs of the White Nations are reorganized,\nsocial decay and race deterioration are inevitable.The decline in white population that is taking place in many\ncommunities throughout several countries illustrates the widespread\nworking of the forces that are responsible for this degeneration. In\ndiscussing this matter in its relation to Australia, S. R. Wolstenhole,(3)lecturer in economics at Sydney University,\npredicts that:A decline in Australia's population is\ninevitable within 40 years because of the absence of a vigorous\npopulation policy.Students of our modern social problems are recognizing that\nthese problems are not limited to health conditions which we have been\naccustomed to think of as bodily diseases. This is illustrated in a\nrecent discussion by Will Durant:(4)The American people are face to face with at\nleast 4 major and militant problems that have to do with the continuity\nand worthwhile progress of modern civilization:The threatened deterioration of our\nstock.The purchasing power of our people must rise as\nfast as the power to procure. . . .The third problem is moral. A civilization depends\nupon morals for a social and governmental order. . . .The sources of statesmanship are drying up.\n.. .Dental caries or tooth decay is recognized as affecting more\nindividuals throughout the so-called civilized world today than any\nother affection. In the United States, England and Europe examinations\nof highly modernized groups, consisting of several million individuals,\nreveal the fact that from 85 to 100 per cent of the individuals in\nvarious communities are suffering from this affection. As a\ncontributing factor to absence from school among children it leads all\nother affections. From the standpoint of injury to health, it has been\nestimated by many to be the most serious contributing factor through\nits involvement of other organs of the body. The Honorable J. A. Young,\nMinister of Health of New Zealand, strongly emphasized that the\ninsidiousness of the effect of dental disease lies in the fact that it\nis the forerunner of other far-reaching disturbances and he has\nreferred to the seriousness with which it is viewed in England as\nfollows: \"Sir George Newman, Principal Medical Officer of the Ministry\nof Health in Great Britain, has said that 'dental disease is one of the\nchief, if not the chief, cause of the ill health of the people.'\"Dr. Earnest A. Hooton, of Harvard University, has emphasized the\nimportance of oral sepsis and the task of stopping tooth decay. In\nclosing Chapter VII of his recent book \"Apes, Men and Morons,\"(5)he states the case as follows:I firmly believe that the health of humanity is\nat stake, and that, unless steps are taken to discover preventives of\ntooth infection and correctives of dental deformation, the course of\nhuman evolution will lead downward to extinction. . . . The facts that\nwe must face are, in brief, that human teeth and the human mouth have\nbecome, possibly under the influence of civilization, the foci of\ninfections that undermine the entire bodily health of the species and\nthat degenerative tendencies in evolution have manifested themselves in\nmodern man to such an extent that our jaws are too small for the teeth\nwhich they are supposed to accommodate, and that, as a consequence,\nthese teeth erupt so irregularly that their fundamental efficiency is\noften entirely or nearly destroyed.In discussing the strategic situation of dental science, Dr. Hooton\nstates.In my opinion there is one and only one course\nof action which will check the increase of dental disease and\ndegeneration which may ultimately cause the extinction of the human\nspecies. This is to elevate the dental profession to a plane on which\nit can command the services of our best research minds to study the\ncauses and seek for the cures of these dental evils. . . . The dental\npractitioner should equip himself to become the agent of an intelligent\ncontrol of human evolution, insofar as it is affected by diet. Let us\ngo to the ignorant savage, consider his way of eating, and be wise. Let\nus cease pretending that tooth-brushes and tooth-paste are any more\nimportant than shoe-brushes and shoe-polish. It is store food which has\ngiven us store teeth.Students of history have continually commented upon the superior\nteeth of the so-called savages including the human types that have\npreceded our modernized groups. While dental caries has been found\noccasionally in several animal species through the recent geologic\nages, the teeth of the human species have been comparatively free from\ndental caries. Primitive human beings have been freer from the disease\nthan has contemporary animal life. This absence of tooth decay among\nprimitive races has been so striking a characteristic of human kind\nthat many commentators have referred to it as a strikingly modern\ndisease.Dryer,(6)in discussing dental caries in\nthe pre-historic South Africans, makes this comment:In not one of a very large collection of teeth\nfrom skulls obtained in the Matjes River Shelter (Holocene) was there\nthe slightest sign of dental caries. The indication from this area,\ntherefore, bears out the experience of European anthropologists that\ncaries is a comparatively modern disease and that no skull showing this\ncondition can be regarded as ancient.In connection with the studies reported in this volume, it is of\nparticular importance that a desire to find the cause of dental caries\nwas the primary reason for undertaking these investigations. Since it\nwas exceedingly difficult to find in our modern social organization any\nlarge group with relatively high immunity to dental caries, a search\nwas made for such control groups among remnants of primitive racial\nstocks that could also be examined at the point of contact with modern\ncivilization in order that the changes associated with their racial\nloss of immunity might be noted. Probably few problems with which our\nmodern social groups are concerned have been so inadequately understood\nnot only by the laity, but by the members of the medical and dental\nprofessions as has this problem of the cause of dental caries.The problem of correcting dental arch deformities and thereby\nimproving facial form has developed a specialty in dentistry known as\n\"orthodontia.\" The literature dealing with the cause of facial\ndeformities is now voluminous. The blending of racial stocks that\ndiffer radically in facial form has been said by many to be the chief\nfactor contributing to the creation of deformities of the face. Crowded\nteeth have been said to be due to the inheritance of the large teeth of\none parent and the small bone formation of the other and that such\ninheritances would provide dental arches that are too small for the\nteeth that have been made for them. A more general explanation for\ncertain types of deformity, particularly for the protruding of the\nupper teeth over the lower, is that they result from thumb sucking,\nwhich tends to bring the upper arch forward and to depress the lower.\nAmong the other contributing factors named have been faulty sleeping\nand breathing habits. To these has been assigned much of the blame.\nThis problem of facial form, as well as that of bodily design,\nincluding dental arch design, is so directly a problem of growth, not\nonly of individuals, but of races themselves, that certain laws have\nbeen very definitely worked out by physical anthropologists as laws of\ndevelopment. They have assumed that changes in physical type can occur\nonly through the impact of changes in the environment which have\naffected a great number of generations. It is important to keep this\nviewpoint in mind as the succeeding chapters are read, for they contain\ndescriptions of many changes in physical form that have occurred\nroutinely in the various racial groups, even during the first\ngeneration after the parents have adopted the foods of modern\ncivilization.Many of our modern writers have recognized and have emphasized\nthe seriousness of mental and moral degeneration. Laird has made a\nsplendid contribution under the title \"The Tail That Wags the Nation,\"(7)in which he states:The country's average level of general ability\nsinks lower with each generation. Should the ballot be restricted to\ncitizens able to take care of themselves? One out of four cannot. . . .\nThe tail is now wagging Washington, and Wall St. and LaSalle Street. .\n. . Each generation has seen some lowering of the American average\nlevel of general ability.In Laird's analysis of our present situation he has stressed a\nvery important phase. While emphasizing that the degeneration is not\nlimited to restricted areas, he raises the question as to whether local\nconditions in certain areas play important roles in the rate and extent\nto which degeneration has taken place. He says further,(7)Although we might cite any one of nearly two\ndozen states, we will first mention Vermont by name because that is the\nplace studied by the late Dr. Pearce Bailey. \"It would be,\" he wrote,\n\"safe to assume that there are at least 30 defectives per 1000 in\nVermont of the eight-year-old mentality type, and 300 per 1000 of\nbackward or retarded persons, persons of distinctly inferior\nintelligence. In other words, nearly one-third of the whole population\nof that state is of a type to require some supervision.\"The problem of lowered mentality and its place in our modern\nconception of bodily diseases has not been placed on a physical basis\nas have the better understood degenerative processes, with their direct\nrelationship to a diseased organ, but has generally been assigned to a\nrealm entirely outside the domain of disease or injury of a special\norgan or tissue. Edward Lee Thorndike,(8)of\nColumbia University, says that \"thinking is as biological as\ndigestion.\" This implies that a disturbance in the capacity to think is\ndirectly related to a defect in the brain.Another of the distinguished students of mental capacity, J. B.\nMiner,(9)states:If morality and intellect are finally\ndemonstrated to be correlated throughout the whole range of individual\ndifferences, it is probably the most profoundly significant fact with\nwhich society has to deal.The origin of backwardness in a child seems to have been\nassigned very largely to some experience in that child's life which\nbecomes a conditioning factor and which thereafter strongly influences\nhis behavior. The problem of the relation of physical defects to\ndelinquency in its various phases, including major crime, constitutes\none of the most alarming aspects of our modern problems in social\ndegeneration. Chassell(10)has made an\nexhaustive study of the reports from workers in different fields in\nseveral countries and summarizes her finding as follows: \"The\ncorrelation between delinquency and mental inferiority as found in the\ncase of feeble-minded groups is clearly positive, and tends to be\nmarked in degree.\"Burt,(11)who had made an extensive\nstudy, over an extended period, of the problems of the backward child\nand the delinquent child in London, states in his summary and\nconclusion with regard to the origin of backwardness in the child:Both at London and at Birmingham between 60 and\n70 per cent belong to the (innately) \"dull\" category. . . . In the\nmajority the outstanding cause is a general inferiority of intellectual\ncapacity, presumably inborn and frequently hereditary.In discussing the relationship between general physical weakness and\nthe mentally backward, he writes:Old and time-honoured as it must seem to the\nschoolmaster, the problem of the backward child has never been attacked\nby systematic research until quite recently. We know little about\ncauses, and still less about treatment. . . . Thirdly, though the vast\nmajority of backward children--80 per cent in an area like\nLondon--prove to be suffering from minor bodily ailments or from\ncontinued ill-health, nevertheless general physical weakness is rarely\nthe main factor.Among the many surveys made in the study of the forces that are\nresponsible for producing delinquency and criminality, practically all\nthe workers in this field have testified to the obscure nature of those\nforces. Burt(12)says that, \"it is almost as\nthough crime were some contagious disease, to which the\nconstitutionally susceptible were suddenly exposed at puberty, or to\nwhich puberty left them peculiarly prone.\" He emphasizes a relationship\nbetween delinquency and physical deficiency:Most repeated offenders are far from robust;\nthey are frail, sickly, and infirm. Indeed, so regularly is chronic\nmoral disorder associated with chronic physical disorder that many have\ncontended that crime is a disease, or at least a symptom of disease,\nneeding the doctor more than the magistrate, physic rather than the\nwhip..     .      .      .      .      .      .The frequency among juvenile delinquents of\nbodily weakness and ill health has been remarked by almost every recent\nwriter. In my own series of cases nearly 70 per cent were suffering\nfrom such defects; and nearly 50 per cent were in urgent need of\nmedical treatment. . . . Of all the psychological causes of crime, the\ncommonest and the gravest is usually alleged to be defective mind. The\nmost eminent authorities, employing the most elaborate methods of\nscientific analysis, have been led to enunciate some such belief. In\nEngland, for example, Dr. Goring has affirmed that \"the one vital\nmental constitutional factor in the etiology of crime is defective\nintelligence.\" In Chicago, Dr. Healy has likewise maintained that among\nthe personal characteristics of the offender \"mental deficiency forms\nthe largest single cause of delinquency.\" And most American\ninvestigators would agree.The assertion of the obscurity of the fundamental causative\nfactors of delinquency constitutes one of the most striking aspects of\nthe extensive literature that has been accumulated through the\nreporting of intensive studies made by workers in many countries.Thrasher,(13)in discussing the nature\nand origin of gangs, expresses this very clearly:Gangs are gangs, wherever they are found. They\nrepresent a specific type or variety of society, and one thing that is\nparticularly interesting about them is the fact that they are, in\nrespect to their organization, so elementary, and in respect to their\norigin, so spontaneous.Formal society is always more or less conscious\nof the end for which it exists, and the organization through which this\nend is achieved is always more or less a product of design. But gangs\ngrow like weeds, without consciousness of their aims, and without\nadministrative machinery to achieve them. They are, in fact, so\nspontaneous in their origin, and so little conscious of the purposes\nfor which they exist, that one is tempted to think of them as\npredetermined, foreordained, and \"instinctive,\" and so, quite\nindependent of the environment in which they ordinarily are\nfound.No doubt, many cities have been provided, as has Cleveland, with\na special school for delinquent boys. The institution there has been\ngiven the appropriate title, the \"Thomas A. Edison School.\" It usually\nhas an enrollment of 800 to 900 boys. Dr. Watson,(14)who has been of outstanding service in the\norganization of this work, makes an important comment on the origin of\nthe student population there:The Thomas A. Edison student population consists\nof a group of truant and behavior boys, most of them in those earlier\nstages of mal-adjustment which we have termed predelinquency. . . . In\ngeneral, they are the products of unhappy experiences in school, home\nand community. They are sensitive recorders of the total complex of\nsocial forces which operate in and combine to constitute what we term\ntheir community environment.It will be seen from these quotations that great emphasis has\nbeen placed upon the influence of the environment in determining\nfactors of delinquency.Hooton, the distinguished physical anthropologist of Harvard,\nhas made important observations regarding our modern physical\ndegeneration. As an approach to this larger problem of man's\nprogressive degeneration, he has proposed the organization and\nestablishment of an Institute of Clinical Anthropology,(15)the purpose of which he has indicated:. . . for finding out what man is like biologically\nwhen he does not need a doctor, in order to further ascertain what he\nshould be like after the doctor has finished with him. I am entirely\nserious when I suggest that it is a very myopic medical science which\nworks backward from the morgue rather than forward from the\ncradle.Very important contributions have been made to the forces that\nare at work in the development of delinquents through an examination of\nthe families in which affected individuals have appeared. Sullenger,(16)in discussing this phase, states:Abbott and Breckinridge found in their Chicago\nstudies that a much higher percentage of delinquent boys than girls\nwere from large families. However, Healy and Bronner found in their\nstudies in Chicago and Boston that the large family is conducive to\ndelinquency among children in that the larger the family the greater\npercentage of cases with more than one delinquent. They were unable to\ndetect whether or not this fact was due to parental neglect, poverty,\nbad environmental conditions, or the influence of one child on another.\nIn each of the series in both cities the number of delinquents in\nfamilies of different sizes showed general similarity.As the investigations outlined in this study are reviewed, many\nproblems not anticipated by the writer when these investigations were\nundertaken will be presented. These new problems were not, at first,\ngenerally thought of as related directly or indirectly to our modern\nracial degeneration, but have been found recently to be so related.Since it will be seen that the size and shape of the head and\nsinuses, including the oral cavity and throat, are directly influenced\nby forces that are at work in our modern civilization, we shall\nconsider the speaking and singing voice. In traveling among several of\nthe primitive races, one is frequently impressed with the range and\nresonance of many of the voices--in fact, by almost every voice. We are\nquite familiar with the high premium that is placed on singing voices\nof exceptional quality in our modern social order. This is illustrated\nby the following comment:(17)Tip-top Italian-style tenors have always been a\nscarce commodity, and for the past two decades they have been growing\nscarcer and scarcer. Opera impresarios count on the fingers of one hand\nthe lust-high-voice Latins. . . . Since the death of Enrico Caruso\n(1921) opera houses have shown a steady decline.Important light will be thrown on this phase of the problem--the\ncause of fewer good voices in Italy today than of old--as we note the\nnarrowing of the face and of the dental arches and as we see the change\nin the form of the palate of the various primitive races. These changes\noccur even in the first generation after the parents have adopted the\nfoods of modern white civilizations.As we study the primitives we will find that they have had an\nentirely different conception of the nature and origin of the\ncontrolling forces which have molded individuals and races.Buckle,(18)in writing his epoch-making\n\"History of Civilization\" about the middle of the last century, summed\nup his years of historical studies with some very important\nconclusions, some of which are as follows:2. It is proved by history, and especially by\nstatistics, that human actions are governed by laws as fixed and\nregular as those which rule in the physical world.3. Climate, soil, food, and the aspects of\nNature are the principal causes of intellectual progress.6. Religion, literature, and government are, at\nbest, but the products, and not the cause of civilization.This important view was not orthodox and was met by very severe\ncriticism. The newer knowledge strongly corroborates his view.My early studies of the relation of nutrition to dental problems\nwere related chiefly to growth defects in the teeth produced long\nbefore the eruption of the permanent teeth, chiefly from one year of\nage to the time of eruption. These often appeared as lines across the\nteeth. I was able to trace these lines directly to the use of a few\nhighly processed baby foods. I published an extensive report on this\nphase of the problem, together with illustrations, in 1913.(19)These injuries are disclosed with the x-ray long\nbefore the teeth erupt. These disturbances occur much less frequently\nin connection with the baby foods used today.The problems of modern degeneration can in general be divided\ninto two main groups, those which relate to the perfection of the\nphysical body and those which relate to its function. The latter\ninclude character as expressed in behavior of individuals and of groups\nof individuals which thus relate to national character and to an entire\nculture.In an enumeration of the phases in which there is a progressive\ndecline of modern civilization, it is essential that we keep in mind\nthat in addition to an analysis of the forces responsible for\nindividual degeneration, the ethical standards of the whole group\ncannot be higher than those of the individuals that compose it. That\nrecent mass degeneration is in progress is attested by daily events\nthroughout the world. The current interpretation for individual\ncharacter degeneration largely places the responsibility on a\nconditioning factor which exerts an influence during early childhood\nand therefore is directly related to the environment of the child.\nThese, therefore, are postnatal conditioning factors. An important\ncontribution to this phase comes directly from the experience of\nprimitive races and indicates that a more fundamental conditioning\nfactor had developed in the prenatal period. If, therefore, large\ngroups of individuals suffer from such a prenatal conditioning\ninfluence, new light will be thrown upon the larger problems of group\ndeterioration. History seems to provide records of such mass\ndegeneration as, for example, those which culminated in the so-called\n\"dark ages.\" That some such mass degeneration is now in progress is\nsuggested by leading students of human welfare. The regius professor of\nGreek at Oxford in his inaugural lecture in 1937 made the following\nobservation:(20)In the revolution of thought through which we are\nliving, the profoundest and most disturbing element is the breakdown of\nthat ethical system which, since the days of Constantine, has imposed\nupon European culture at least the semblance of moral unity.In commenting on this important statement Sir Alfred Zimmern in his\naddress on the decline of international standards said that \"Recent\nevents should convince the dullest mind of the extent to which\ninternational standards have deteriorated and the anarchy which\nthreatens the repudiation of law and order in favour of brute\nforce.\"The problem of progressive decline in individual and group\nethical standards is commanding the attention of great international\norganizations. In discussing this problem before the International\nRotary at its meeting in San Francisco in June, 1938, one of the\nleaders in mass reform, Mayor Harold Burton of Cleveland, stressed very\nimportant phases. He stated that the American boys \"are making\nirrevocable choices\" between good and bad citizenship which \"may make\nor wreck the nation. It may be on the battlefield of crime prevention\nthat the life of democracy will be saved.\" He described great\nindustrial cities as battlefields where \"the tests of democracy are the\nnewest and sharpest.\"(21). . . \"For\ncenturies,\" he said:. . . we have fought crime primarily by seeking to\ncatch the criminal after the crime has been committed and then through\nhis punishment to lead or drive him and others to good citizenship.\nToday the greater range of operation and greater number of criminals\nargue that we must deal with the flood waters of crime. We must prevent\nthe flood by study, control and diversion of the waters at their\nrespective sources. To do this we must direct the streams of growing\nboys in each community away from fields of crime to those of good\ncitizenship.If the \"flood waters\" that must be controlled lie farther back\nthan the cradle, in order to safeguard individual character and\nindividual citizenship from prenatal conditioning factors which have\nprofound influence in determining the reaction of the individuals to\nthe environment, it is essential that programs that are to be efficient\nin maintaining national character reach back to those forces which are\ncausing the degeneration of increasing numbers of the population in\nsucceeding generations of our modern cultures.That the problem of mass degeneration constitutes one of the\nmost alarming problems of our modernized cultures is demonstrated by\nthe urgency of appeals that are being made by students in national and\ninternational affairs. The discussion of \"An Ethical Declaration for\nthe Times,\"(22)a declaration of faith, is\naccompanied by a pledge. This pledge reads:I pledge myself to use every opportunity for\naction to uphold the great tradition of civilization to protect all\nthose who may suffer for its sake, and to pass it on to the coming\ngenerations. I recognized no loyalty greater than that to the task of\npreserving truth, toleration, and justice in the coming world\norder.The author emphasizes the great danger of taking for granted that\nthe cultural progress that has been attained will continue. There is\nprobably no phase of this whole problem of modern degeneration that is\nso brilliantly illuminated by the accumulated wisdom of primitive races\nas group degeneration. They have so organized the life of the family\nand the individual that the nature of the forces which established\nindividual behavior and character are controlled.Our problem of modern degeneration involves both individual and\ngroup destiny. Our approach to this study will, accordingly, involve\nfirst a critical examination of the forces that are responsible for\nindividual degeneration.In my search for the cause of degeneration of the human face and\nthe dental organs I have been unable to find an approach to the problem\nthrough the study of affected individuals and diseased tissues. In my\ntwo volume work on \"Dental Infections,\" Volume I, entitled \"Dental\nInfections, Oral and Systemic,\" and Volume II, entitled \"Dental\nInfections and the Degenerative Diseases,\"(23)I reviewed at length the researches that I had conducted to throw light\non this problem. The evidence seemed to indicate clearly that the\nforces that were at work were not to be found in the diseased tissues,\nbut that the undesirable conditions were the result of the absence of\nsomething, rather than of the presence of something. This strongly\nindicated the need for finding groups of individuals so physically\nperfect that they could be used as controls. In order to discover them,\nI determined to search out primitive racial stocks that were free from\nthe degenerative processes with which we are concerned in order to note\nwhat they have that we do not have. These field investigations have\ntaken me to many parts of the world through a series of years.

It\nwas my desire to find, if possible, groups of Swiss living in a\nphysical environment such that their isolation would compel them to\nlive largely on locally produced foods. Officials of the Swiss\nGovernment were consulted as to the possibility of finding people in\nSwitzerland whose physical isolation provided an adequate protection.\nWe were told that the physical conditions that would not permit people\nto obtain modern foods would prevent us from reaching them without\nhardship. However, owing to the completion of the Loetschberg Tunnel,\neleven miles long, and the building of a railroad that crosses the\nLoetschental Valley, at a little less than a mile above sea level, a\ngroup of about 2,000 people had been made easily accessible for study,\nshortly prior to 1931. Practically all the human requirements of the\npeople in that valley, except a few items like sea salt, have been\nproduced in the valley for centuries.A bird's eye view of the Loetschental Valley, looking toward the\nentrance, is shown in Fig. 1. The people of this valley have a history\ncovering more than a dozen centuries. The architecture of their wooden\nbuildings, some of them several centuries old, indicates a love for\nsimple stability, adapted to expediency and efficiency. Artistically\ndesigned mottoes, many of them centuries old, are carved deep in the\nheavy supporting timbers, both within and without the buildings. They\nare always expressive of devotion to cultural and spiritual values\nrather than to material values. These people have never been conquered,\nalthough many efforts have been made to invade their valley. Except for\nthe rugged cleft through which the river descends to the Rhone Valley,\nthe Loetschental Valley is almost completely enclosed by three high\nmountain ranges which are usually snow-capped. This pass could be\nguarded by a small band against any attacking forces since artificial\nlandslides could easily be released. The natural occurrence of these\nlandslides has made passage through the gorge hazardous, if not\nimpossible, for months of the year. According to early legends of the\nvalley these mountains were the parapets of the universe, and the great\nglacier of the valley, the end of the universe. The glacier is a branch\nof the great ice field that stretches away to the west and south from\nthe ice-cap of the Jungfrau and Monch. The mountains, however, are\nseldom approached from this direction because of the hazardous ice\nfields. The gateway to them with which the traveling world is familiar\nis from Interlaken by way of the Lauterbrunnen or Grindelwald\nvalleys.Fig. 1. Beautiful Loetschental\nValley about a mile above sea level. About two thousand Swiss live\nhere. In 1932 no deaths had occurred from tuberculosis in the history\nof the valley.At the altitude of the Loetschental Valley the winters are long,\nand the summers short but beautiful, and accompanied by extraordinarily\nrapid and luxuriant growth. The meadows are fragrant with Alpine\nflowers, with violets like pansies, which bloom all summer in deepest\nhues.The people of the Loetschental Valley make up a community of two\nthousand who have been a world unto themselves. They have neither\nphysician nor dentist because they have so little need for them; they\nhave neither policeman nor jail, because they have no need for them.\nThe clothing has been the substantial homespuns made from the wool of\ntheir sheep. The valley has produced not only everything that is needed\nfor clothing, but practically everything that is needed for food. It\nhas been the achievement of the valley to build some of the finest\nphysiques in all Europe. This is attested to by the fact that many of\nthe famous Swiss guards of the Vatican at Rome, who are the admiration\nof the world and are the pride of Switzerland, have been selected from\nthis and other Alpine valleys. It is every Loetschental boy's ambition\nto be a Vatican guard. Notwithstanding the fact that tuberculosis is\nthe most serious disease of Switzerland, according to a statement given\nme by a government official, a recent report of inspection of this\nvalley did not reveal a single case. I was aided in my studies in\nSwitzerland by the excellent cooperation of the Reverend John Siegen,\nthe pastor of the one church of this beautiful valley.The people live largely in a series of villages dotting the\nvalley floor along the river bank. The land that is tilled, chiefly for\nproducing hay for feeding the cattle in the winter and rye for feeding\nthe people, extends from the river and often rises steeply toward the\nmountains which are wooded with timber so precious for protection that\nlittle of it has been disturbed. Fortunately, there is much more on the\nvast area of the mountain sides than is needed for the relatively small\npopulation. The forests have been jealously guarded because they are so\ngreatly needed to prevent slides of snow and rocks which might engulf\nand destroy the villages.The valley has a fine educational system of alternate didactic\nand practical work. All children are required to attend school six\nmonths of the year and to spend the other six months helping with the\nfarming and dairying industry in which young and old of both sexes must\nwork. The school system is under the direct supervision of the Catholic\nChurch, and the work is well done. The girls are also taught weaving,\ndyeing and garment making. The manufacture of wool and clothing is the\nchief homework for the women in the winter.No trucks nor even horses and wagons, let alone tractors, are\navailable to bear the burdens up and down the mountain sides. This is\nall done on human backs for which the hearts of the people have been\nmade especially strong.We are primarily concerned here with the quality of the teeth\nand the development of the faces that are associated with such splendid\nhearts and unusual physiques. I made studies of both adults and growing\nboys and girls, during the summer of 1931, and arranged to have samples\nof food, particularly dairy products, sent to me about twice a month,\nsummer and winter. These products have been tested for their mineral\nand vitamin contents, particularly the fat-soluble activators. The\nsamples were found to be high in vitamins and much higher than the\naverage samples of commercial dairy products in America and Europe, and\nin the lower areas of Switzerland.Hay is cut for winter feeding of the cattle, and this hay grows\nrapidly. The hay proved, on chemical analysis made at my laboratory, to\nbe far above the average in quality for pasturage and storage grasses.\nAlmost every household has goats or cows or both. In the summer the\ncattle seek the higher pasturage lands and follow the retreating snow\nwhich leaves the lower valley free for the harvesting of the hay and\nrye. The turning of the soil is done by hand, since there are neither\nplows nor draft animals to drag the plows, in preparation for the next\nyear's rye crop. A limited amount of garden stuff is grown, chiefly\ngreen foods for summer use. While the cows spend the warm summer on the\nverdant knolls and wooded slopes near the glaciers and fields of\nperpetual snow, they have a period of high and rich productivity of\nmilk. The milk constitutes an important part of the summer's\nharvesting. While the men and boys gather in the hay and rye, the women\nand children go in large numbers with the cattle to collect the milk\nand make and store cheese for the following winter's use. This cheese\ncontains the natural butter fat and minerals of the splendid milk and\nis a virtual storehouse of life for the coming winter.From Dr. Siegen, I learned much about the life and customs of\nthese people. He told me that they recognize the presence of Divinity\nin the life-giving qualities of the butter made in June when the cows\nhave arrived for pasturage near the glaciers. He gathers the people\ntogether to thank the kind Father for the evidence of his Being in the\nlife-giving qualities of butter and cheese made when the cows eat the\ngrass near the snow line. This worshipful program includes the lighting\nof a wick in a bowl of the first butter made after the cows have\nreached the luscious summer pasturage. This wick is permitted to burn\nin a special sanctuary built for the purpose. The natives of the valley\nare able to recognize the superior quality of their June butter, and,\nwithout knowing exactly why, pay it due homage.The nutrition of the people of the Loetschental Valley,\nparticularly that of the growing boys and girls, consists largely of a\nslice of whole rye bread and a piece of the summer-made cheese (about\nas large as the slice of bread), which are eaten with fresh milk of\ngoats or cows. Meat is eaten about once a week. In the light of our\nnewer knowledge of activating substances, including vitamins, and the\nrelative values of food for supplying minerals for body building, it is\nclear why they have healthy bodies and sound teeth. The average total\nfat-soluble activator and mineral intake of calcium and phosphorus of\nthese children would far exceed that of the daily intake of the average\nAmerican child. The sturdiness of the child life permits children to\nplay and frolic bareheaded and barefooted even in water running down\nfrom the glacier in the late evening's chilly breezes, in weather that\nmade us wear our overcoats and gloves and button our collars. Of all\nthe children in the valley still using the primitive diet of whole rye\nbread and dairy products the average number of cavities per person was\n0.3. On an average it was necessary to examine three persons to find\none defective deciduous or permanent tooth. The children examined were\nbetween seven and sixteen years of age.If one is fortunate enough to be in the valley in early August\nand witness the earnestness with which the people celebrate their\nnational holiday, he will be privileged to see a sight long to be\nremembered. These celebrations close with the gathering together of the\nmountaineers on various crags and prominences where great bonfires are\nlighted from fuel that has been accumulated and built into an enormous\nmound to make a huge torchlight. These bonfires are lighted at a given\nhour from end to end of the valley throughout its expanse. Every\nmountaineer on a distant crag seeing the lights knows that the others\nare signalling to him that they, too, are making their sacred\nconsecration in song which says one for all and all for one.\" This\nmotive has been crystallized into action and has become a part of the\nvery souls of the people. One understands why doors do not need to be\nbolted in the Loetschental Valley.How different the level of life and horizon of such souls from\nthose in many places in the so-called civilized world in which people\nhave degraded themselves until life has no interest in values that\ncannot be expressed in gold or pelf, which they would obtain even\nthough the life of the person being cheated or robbed would thereby be\ncrippled or blotted out.One immediately wonders if there is not something in the\nlife-giving vitamins and minerals of the food that builds not only\ngreat physical structures within which their souls reside, but builds\nminds and hearts capable of a higher type of manhood in which the\nmaterial values of life are made secondary to individual character. In\nsucceeding chapters we will see evidence that this is the case.Our quest has been for information relative to the health of the\nbody, the perfection of the teeth, and the normality of development of\nfaces and dental arches, in order that we might through an analysis of\nthe foods learn the secret of such splendid body building and learn\nfrom the people of the valley how the nutrition of all groups of people\nmay be reinforced, so that they, too, may be free from mankind's most\nuniversal disease, tooth decay and its sequelae. These studies included\nnot only the making of a physical examination of the teeth, the\nphotographing of subjects, the recording of voluminous data, the\nobtaining of samples of food for chemical analysis, the collecting of\ndetailed information regarding daily menus; but also the collecting of\nsamples of saliva for chemical analysis. The chemical analysis of\nsaliva was used to test out my newly developed procedure for estimating\nthe level of immunity to dental caries for a given person at a given\ntime. This procedure is outlined in following chapters. The samples of\nsaliva were preserved by an addition of formalin equivalent in amount\nto one per cent of the sample of saliva.These children will, it is hoped, be reexamined in succeeding\nyears in order to make comparative studies of the effect of the changes\nin the local nutritional programs. Some of these changes are already in\nprogress. There is now a modern bakery dispensing white bread and many\nwhite-flour products which was in full operation in 1932.I inquired of many persons regarding the most favorable\ndistricts in which to make further studies of groups of people living\nin protected isolation because of their physical environment, and\ndecided to study some special high Alpine valleys between the Rhone\nValley and Italy, which I included in 1932. The Canton of Wallis is\nbordered by French-speaking people on the west, by Italian-speaking\npeople on the south, and by German-speaking people on the east and\nnorth. I had as guides and interpreters in Wallis, Dr. Alfred Gysi and\nalso Dr. Adolf Roos through part of the territory.Our first expedition was into the valley of the Visp which is a\ngreat gorge extending southward from the Rhone River, dividing into two\ngorges, one going to the Saas Fee country, and the other to the\nvicinity of the Matterhorn with its almost spirelike pinnacle lifting\nitself above the surrounding snow-capped mountains and visible from\neminences in all directions as one of the mightiest and most sublime\nspectacles in the world. It was one of the last mountains of Europe to\nbe scaled by man. One has not seen the full majesty of the Alps if he\nhas not seen the Matterhorn.We left the mountain railroad, which makes many of the grades\nwith the cog system, at the town of St. Nicholas, and climbed the\nmountain trail to an isolated settlement on the east bank of the\nMattervisp River, called Grachen, a five-hour journey. The settlement\nis on a shelf high above the east side of the river where it is exposed\nto southern sunshine and enjoys a unique isolation because of its\nphysical inaccessibility. An examination made of the children in this\ncommunity showed that only 2.3 teeth out of every hundred had been\nattacked by tooth decay.The hardihood of the people was splendidly illustrated by a\nwoman of 62 years who carried an enormous load of rye on her back at an\naltitude of about 5,000 feet. We met her later and talked to her, and\nfound that she was extraordinarily well developed and well preserved.\nShe showed us her grandchildren who had fine physiques and facial\ndevelopments.The rye is so precious that while being carried the heads are\nprotected by wrapping them in canvas so that not a kernel will be lost.\nThe rye is thrashed by hand and ground in stone mills which were\nformerly hand-turned like the one shown in Fig. 2. Recently water\nturbines have been installed. Water power is abundant and the grinding\nis done for the people of the mountain side in these water-driven\nmills. Only wholerye flour is available. Each household takes turns in\nusing the community bake-oven, which is shown in Fig. 2. A month's\nsupply of whole-rye bread is baked at one time for a given family.FIG. 2. For centuries the\nnatives ground their rye in this type of hand mill. This community\nbake-oven for whole rye bread is passing.Here again the cows were away in the midsummer, pasturing up\nnear the glaciers. Grachen has an altitude of about 5,000 feet. The\nchurch at Grachen was built several hundred years ago. We were shown an\nembossed certificate of honor and privilege extended to a group of\nabout 120 people who had originally built the edifice. We were given\nvalued assistance by the local priest, and were provided with\nfacilities in his spacious and well-kept rooms for making our studies\nof the children.From Grachen we returned to St. Nicholas and proceeded from\nthere by train down the valley and up another steep ascent, requiring\nseveral hours, to the hamlet of Visperterminen, on the east side of the\nmountain above the Visp River, and below the junction of the Mattervisp\nand Saaservisp. This community is made up of about 1,600 people living\non a sheltered shelf high above the river valley. The view from this\nposition is indescribably beautiful. It is a little below the timber\nline of this and the surrounding mountains. Majestic snow-clad peaks\nand precipitous mountains dot the horizon and shade off into winding\ngorges which mark the course of wandering streams several thousand feet\nbelow our vantage point. It is a place to stop and ponder.The gradations in climate range in the summer from a tropical\ntemperature in protected nooks during the daytime to sub-zero weather\nwith raging blizzards at night on the high mountains. It is a place\nwhere human stamina can be tempered to meet all the vicissitudes of\nlife.The village consists of a group of characteristically designed\nSwiss chalets clustered on the mountain side. The church stands out as\na beacon visible from mountains in all directions. Visperterminen is\nunique in many respects. Notwithstanding its relative proximity to\ncivilization--it is only a few hours' journey to the thoroughfare of\nthe Rhone Valley--it has enjoyed isolation and opportunity for\nmaintaining its characteristic primitive social and civil life. We were\ngreeted here by the president of the village who graciously opened the\nschool house and sent messengers to have the children of the community\npromptly come to the school building in order that we might make such\nstudies as we desired. This study included a physical examination of\nthe teeth and of the general development of the children, particularly\nof the faces and dental arches, the making of photographic records, the\nobtaining of samples of saliva, as in other places, and also the making\nof a detailed study of the nutrition. In addition, we obtained samples\nof foods for chemical analysis.The people of Visperterminen have the unique distinction of\nowning land in the lower part of the mountain on which they maintain\nvineyards to supply wine for this country. They have the highest\nvineyards of Europe. They are grown on banks that are often so steep\nthat one wonders how the tillers of the soil or the gatherers of the\nfruit can maintain their hold on the precarious and shifting footing.\nEach terrace has a trench near its lower retaining wall to catch the\nsoil that is washed down, and this soil must be carried back in baskets\nto the upper boundary of the plot. This is all done by human labor. The\nvineyards afforded them the additional nutrition of wine and of fruit\nminerals and vitamins which the two groups we studied at Loetschental\nand Grachen did not have.This additional nutrition was of importance because of the\nopportunity for obtaining through it vitamin C. It is of particular\ninterest in the study of the incidence of tooth decay in Visperterminen\nthat these additional factors had not created a higher immunity to\ntooth decay, nor a better condition of health in gingival tissues than\npreviously found. In each one hundred teeth examined 5.2 were found to\nhave been attacked at some time by tooth decay. Here again the\nnutrition consisted of rye, used almost exclusively as the cereal; of\ndairy products; of meat about once a week; and also some potatoes.\nLimited green foods were eaten during the summer. The general custom is\nto have a sheep dressed and distributed to a group of families, thus\nproviding each family with a ration of meat for one day a week, usually\nSunday. The bones and scraps are utilized for making soups to be served\nduring the week. The children have goat's milk in the summer when the\ncows are away in the higher pastures near the snow line. Certain\nmembers of the families go to the higher pastures with the cows to make\ncheese for the coming winter's use.The problem of identifying goats or cattle for establishing\nindividual ownership is a considerable one where the stock of all are\npastured in common herds. It was interesting to us to observe how this\nproblem was met. The president of the village has what is called a\n\"tessel\" which is a string of manikins in imitation of goats or cattle\nmade of wood and leather. Every stock owner must provide a manikin to\nbe left in the safekeeping of the president of the village with whom it\nis registered. It carries on it the individual markings that this\nmember of the colony agrees to put on every member of his animal stock.\nThe marking may be a hole punched in the left ear or a slit in the\nright ear, or any combination of such markings as is desired.\nThereafter all animals carrying that mark are the property of the\nperson who registered it; similarly, any animals that have not this\nindividual symbol of identification cannot be claimed by him.As one stands in profound admiration before the stalwart\nphysical development and high moral character of these sturdy\nmountaineers, he is impressed by the superior types of manhood,\nwomanhood, and childhood that Nature has been able to produce from a\nsuitable diet and a suitable environment. Surely, here is evidence\nenough to answer the question whether cereals should be avoided because\nthey produce acids in the system which if formed will be the cause of\ntooth decay and many other ills including the acidity of the blood or\nsaliva. Surely, the ultimate control will be found in Nature's\nlaboratory where man has not yet been able to meddle sufficiently with\nNature's nutritional program to blight humanity with abnormal and\nsynthetic nutrition. When one has watched for days the childlife in\nthose high Alpine preserves of superior manhood; when one has\ncontrasted these people with the pinched and sallow, and even deformed,\nfaces and distorted bodies that are produced by our modern civilization\nand its diets; and when one has contrasted the unsurpassed beauty of\nthe faces of these children developed on Nature's primitive foods with\nthe varied assortment of modern civilization's children with their\ndefective facial development, he finds himself filled with an earnest\ndesire to see that this betterment is made available for modern\ncivilization.Again and again we had the experience of examining a young man\nor young woman and finding that at some period of his life tooth decay\nhad been rampant and had suddenly ceased; but, during the stress, some\nteeth had been lost. When we asked such people whether they had gone\nout of the mountain and at what age, they generally replied that at\neighteen or twenty years of age they had gone to this or that city and\nhad stayed a year or two. They stated that they had never had a decayed\ntooth before they went or after they returned, but that they had lost\nsome teeth in the short period away from home.At this point of our studies Dr. Roos found it necessary to\nleave, but Dr. Gysi accompanied us to the Anniviers Valley, which is\nalso on the south side of the Rhone. The river of the valley, the\nNavizenze, drains from the high Swiss and Italian boundary north to the\nRhone River. Here again we had the remarkable experience of finding\ncommunities near to each other, one blessed with high immunity to tooth\ndecay, and the other afflicted with rampant tooth decay.The village of Ayer lies in a beautiful valley well up toward\nthe glaciers. It is still largely primitive, although a government road\nhas recently been developed, which, like many of the new arteries, has\nmade it possible to dispatch military protection when and if necessary\nto any community. In this beautiful hamlet, until recently isolated, we\nfound a high immunity to dental caries. Only 2.3 teeth out of each\nhundred examined were found to have been attacked by tooth decay. Here\nagain the people were living on rye and dairy products. We wonder if\nhistory will repeat itself in the next few years and if there, too,\nthis enviable immunity will be lost with the advent of the highway.\nUsually it is not long after tunnels and roads are built that\nautomobiles and wagons enter with modern foods, which begin their\ndestructive work. This fact has been tragically demonstrated in this\nvalley since a roadway was extended as far as Vissoie several years\nago. In this village modern foods have been available for some time.\nOne could probably walk the distance from Ayer to Vissoie in an hour.\nThe number of teeth found to be attacked with caries for each one\nhundred children's teeth examined at Vissoie was 20.2 as compared with\n2.3 at Ayer. We had here a splendid opportunity to study the changes\nthat had occurred in the nutritional programs. With the coming of\ntransportation and new markets there had been shipped in modern white\nflour; equipment for a bakery to make white-flour goods; highly\nsweetened fruit, such as jams, marmalades, jellies, sugar and\nsyrups--all to be traded for the locally produced high-vitamin dairy\nproducts and high-mineral cheese and rye; and with the exchange there\nwas enough money as premium to permit buying machine-made clothing and\nvarious novelties that would soon be translated into necessities.Each valley or village has its own special feast days of which\nathletic contests are the principal events. The feasting in the past\nhas been largely on dairy products. The athletes were provided with\nlarge bowls of cream as constituting one of the most popular and\nhealthful beverages, and special cheese was always available.\nPractically no wine was used because no grapes grew in that valley, and\nfor centuries the isolation of the people prevented access to much\nmaterial that would provide wine. In the Visperterminen community,\nhowever, the special vineyards owned by these people on the lower level\nof the mountain side provided grape juice in various stages of\nfermentation, and their feasts in the past have been celebrated by the\nuse of wines of rare vintage as well as by the use of cream and other\ndairy products. Their cream products took the place of our modern ice\ncream. It was a matter of deep interest to have the President of\nVisperterminen show us the tankards that had been in use in that\ncommunity for nine or ten centuries. The care of these was one of the\nmany responsibilities of the chief executive of the hamlet.It is reported that practically all skulls that are exhumed in\nthe Rhone valley, and, indeed, practically throughout all of\nSwitzerland where graves have existed for more than a hundred years,\nshow relatively perfect teeth; whereas the teeth of people recently\nburied have been riddled with caries or lost through this disease. It\nis of interest that each church usually has associated with it a\ncemetery in which the graves are kept decorated, often with beautiful\ndesigns of fresh or artificial flowers. Members of succeeding\ngenerations of families are said to be buried one above the other to a\ndepth of many feet. Then, after a sufficient number of generations have\nbeen so honored, their bodies are exhumed to make a place for present\nand coming generations. These skeletons are usually preserved with\nhonor and deference. The bones are stacked in basements of certain\nbuildings of the church edifice with the skulls facing outward. These\noften constitute a solid wall of considerable extent. In Naters there\nis such a group said to contain 20,000 skeletons and skulls. These were\nstudied with great interest as was also a smaller collection in\nconnection with the cathedral at Visp. While many of the single\nstraight-rooted teeth had been lost in the handling, many were present.\nIt was a matter of importance to find that only a small percentage of\nteeth had had caries. Teeth that had been attacked with deep caries had\ndeveloped apical abscesses with consequent destruction of the alveolar\nprocesses. Evidence of this bone change was readily visible. Sockets of\nmissing teeth still had continuous walls, indicating that the teeth had\nbeen vital at death.The reader will scarcely believe it possible that such marked\ndifferences in facial form, in the shape of the dental arches, and in\nthe health condition of the teeth as are to be noted when passing from\nthe highly modernized lower valleys and plains country in Switzerland\nto the isolated high valleys can exist. Fig. 3 shows four girls with\ntypically broad dental arches and regular arrangement of the teeth.\nThey have been born and raised in the Loetschental Valley or other\nisolated valleys of Switzerland which provide the excellent nutrition\nthat we have been reviewing. They have been taught little regarding the\nuse of tooth brushes. Their teeth have typical deposits of unscrubbed\nmouths; yet they are almost completely free from dental caries, as are\nthe other individuals of the group they represent. In a study of 4,280\nteeth of the children of these high valleys, only 3.4 per cent were\nfound to have been attacked by tooth decay. This is in striking\ncontrast to conditions found in the modernized sections using the\nmodern foods.FIG. 3. Normal design of face\nand dental arches when adequate nutrition is provided for both the\nparents and the children.Note the well developed nostrils.In Loetschental, Grachen, Visperterminen and Ayer, we have found\ncommunities of native Swiss living almost exclusively on locally\nproduced foods consisting of the cereal, rye, and the animal product,\nmilk, in its various forms. At Vissoie, with its available modern\nnutrition, there has been a complete change in the level of immunity to\ndental caries. It is important that studies be made in other\ncommunities which correspond in altitude with the first four places\nstudied in which there was a high immunity to dental caries. Modern\nfoods should be available in the new communities selected for\ncomparative study. To find such places one would naturally think of\nthose that are world-famed as health resorts providing the best things\nthat modern science and industry can assemble. Surely St. Moritz would\nbe such a place. It is situated in the southeastern part of the\nRepublic of Switzerland near the headwaters of the Danube in the upper\nEngadin. This world-famous watering place attracts people of all\ncontinents for both summer and winter health building and for the\nenjoyment of the mountain lakes, snow-capped peaks, forested mountain\nsides, and crystal clear atmosphere with abundance of sunshine.The journey from the Canton of Wallis (Valais) to the upper\nEngadin takes one up the Rhone valley, climbing continually to get\nabove cascades and beautiful waterfalls until one comes to the great\nRhone glacier which blocks the end of the valley. The water gushes from\nbeneath the mountain of ice to become the parent stream of the Rhone\nriver which passes westward through the Rhone valley receiving\ntributaries from snow-fed streams from both north and south watersheds,\nas it rolls westward to the beautiful Lake Geneva and then onward west\nand south to the Mediterranean.It is of significance that a study of the child life in the\nRhone valley, as made by Swiss officials and reported by Dr. Adolf Roos\nand his associates, shows that practically every child had tooth decay\nand the majority of the children had decay in an aggravated form.\nPeople of this valley are provided with adequate railroad\ntransportation for bringing them the luxuries of the world. As we pass\neastward over the pass through Andermatt, we are reminded that the\ntrains of the St. Gotthard tunnel go thundering through the mountain a\nmile below our feet en route to Italy. To reach our goal, the beautiful\nmodern city and summer resort of St. Moritz, we enter the Engadin\ncountry famed for its beauty and crystal-clear atmosphere. We already\nknow something of the beauty that awaits us which has attracted\npleasure seekers and beauty lovers of the world to St. Moritz. One\nwould scarcely expect to see so modern a city as St. Mortiz at an\naltitude of a little over a mile, with little else to attract people\nthan its climate in winter and summer, the magnificent scenery, and the\nclear atmosphere. We have passed from the communities where almost\neveryone wears homespuns to one of English walking coats and the most\nelegant of feminine attire. Everyone shows the effect of contact with\nculture. The hotels in their appointments and design are reminiscent of\nAtlantic City. Immediately one sees something is different here than in\nthe primitive localities: the children have not the splendidly\ndeveloped features, and the people give no evidence of the great\nphysical reserve that is present in the smaller communities.Through the kindness of Dr. William Barry, a local dentist, and\nthrough that of the superintendent of the public schools, we were\ninvited to use one of the school buildings for our studies of the\nchildren. The summer classes were dismissed with instructions that the\nchildren be retained so that we could have them for study. Several\nfactors were immediately apparent. The teeth were shining and clean,\ngiving eloquent testimony of the thoroughness of the instructions in\nthe use of the modern dentifrices for efficient oral prophylaxis. The\ngums looked better and the teeth more beautiful for having the debris\nand deposits removed. Surely this superb climate, this magnificent\nsetting, combined with the best of the findings of modern prophylactic\nscience, should provide a 100-per-cent immunity to tooth decay. But in\na study of the children from eight to fifteen years of age, 29.8 per\ncent of the teeth had already been attacked by dental caries. Our study\nof each case included careful examining of the mouth; photographing of\nthe face and teeth; obtaining of samples of saliva for chemical\nanalysis; and a study of the program of nutrition followed by the given\ncase. In most cases, the diet was strikingly modern, and the only\nchildren found who did not have tooth decay proved to be children who\nwere eating the natural foods, whole rye bread and plenty of milk.In Chapter 15, a detailed discussion of the chemical differences\nin the food constituents is presented for both the districts subject to\nimmunity, and for those subject to susceptibility.I was told by a former resident of this upper Engadin country\nthat in one of the isolated valleys only a few decades ago the children\nwere still carrying their luncheons to school in the form of roasted\nrye carried dry in their pockets. Their ancestors had eaten cereal in\nthis dry form for centuries.St. Moritz is a typical Alpine community with a physical setting\nlar to that in the Cantons of Bern and Wallis (Valais). It is, however,\nprovided with modern nutrition consisting of an abundance of\nwhite-flour products, marmalades, jams, canned vegetables, confections,\nand fruits--all of which are transported to the district. Only a\nlimited supply of vegetables is grown locally. We studied some children\nhere whose parents retained their primitive methods of food selection,\nand without exception those who were immune to dental caries were\neating a distinctly different food from those with high susceptibility\nto dental caries.Few countries of the world have had officials so untiring in\ntheir efforts to study and tabulate the incidence of dental caries in\nvarious geographic localities as has Switzerland. In the section lying\nto the north and east, and near Lake Constance, there is a considerable\ndistrict where it is reported that 100 per cent of the people are\nsuffering from dental caries. In almost all the other parts of\nSwitzerland in which the population is large 95 to 98 per cent of the\npeople suffer from dental caries. Of the two remaining districts, in\none there is from 90 to 95 per cent and in the other from 85 to 90 per\ncent individual susceptibility to dental caries. Since in the district\nin the vicinity of Lake Constance the incidence of dental caries is so\nhigh that it is recorded as 100 per cent, it seemed especially\ndesirable to make a similar critical study there and to obtain samples\nof saliva and detailed information regarding the food, and to make\ndetailed physical examinations of growing children in this community,\nand through the great kindness of Dr. Hans Eggenberger, Director of\nPublic Health for this general district, we were given an opportunity\nto do so.Arrangements were made by Dr. Eggenberger so that typical groups\nof children, some in institutions, could be studied. He is located at\nHerisau in the Canton of St. Gall. We found work well organized for\nbuilding up the health of these children in so far as outdoor\ntreatment, fresh air, and sunshine were concerned. As dental caries is\na major problem, and probably nutritional, it is treated by sunshine.\nThe boys' group and girls' group are both given suitable athletic\nsports under skillfully trained directors. These groups are located in\ndifferent parts of the city. Their recreation grounds are open lawns\nadjoining wooded knolls which give the children protection and\nisolation in which to play in their sunsuits and build vigorous\nappetites, and thus to prepare for their institutional foods which were\nlargely from a modern menu. Critical dental examinations were made and\nan analysis of the data obtained revealed that one-fourth of all teeth\nof these growing boys and girls had already been attacked by dental\ncaries, and that only 4 per cent of the children had escaped from the\nravages of tooth decay, which disease many of them had in an aggravated\nform.In the Herisau group 25.5 per cent of the 2,065 teeth examined\nhad been attacked by dental caries and many teeth were abscessed. The\nupper photographs in Fig. 4 are of two girls with typically rampant\ntooth decay. The one to the left is sixteen years of age and several of\nher permanent teeth are decayed to the gum line. Her appearance is\nseriously marred, as is also that of the girl to the right.Another change that is seen in passing from the isolated groups\nwith their more nearly normal facial developments, to the groups of the\nlower valleys, is the marked irregularity of the teeth with narrowing\nof the arches and other facial features. In the lower half of Fig. 4\nmay be seen two such cases. While in the isolated groups not a single\ncase of a typical mouth breather was found, many were seen among the\nchildren of the lower-plains group. The children studied were from ten\nto sixteen years of age.Fig. 4. In the modernized\ndistricts of Switzerland tooth decay is rampant. The girl, upper left,\nis sixteen and the one to the right is younger. They use white bread\nand sweets liberally. The two children below have very badly formed\ndental arches with crowding of the teeth. this deformity is not due to\nheredity.Many individuals in the modernized districts bore on their faces\nscars which indicated that the abscess of an infected tooth had broken\nthrough to the external surface where it had developed a fistula with\nresultant scar tissue, thus producing permanent deformity.Bad as these conditions were, we were told that they were better\nthan the average for the community. The ravages of dental caries had\nbeen strikingly evident as we came in contact with the local and\ntraveling public. As we had at St. Moritz, we found an occasional child\nwith much better teeth than the average. Usually the answer was not far\nto seek. For example, in one of the St. Moritz groups, in a class of\nsixteen boys, there were 158 cavities, or an average of 9.8 cavities\nper person (fillings are counted as cavities). In the cases of three\nother children in the same group, there were only three cavities, and\none case was without dental caries. Two of these three had been eating\ndark bread or entire-grain bread, and one was eating dark bread and\noatmeal porridge. All three drank milk liberally.When looking here for the source of dairy products one is\nimpressed by the absence of cows at pasture in the plains of\nSwitzerland, areas in which a large percentage of the entire population\nresides. True, one frequently sees large laiteries or creameries, but\nthe cows are not in sight. On asking the explanation for this, I found\nthat a larger quantity of milk could be obtained from the cows if they\nwere kept in the stables during the period of high production. Indeed,\nthis was a necessity in most of these communities since there were so\nfew fences, and during the time of the growth of the crops, including\nthe stock feed for the winter's use, it was necessary that the cows be\nkept enclosed. About the only time that cows were allowed out on\npasture was in the fall after the crops had been harvested and while\nthe stubble was being plowed.Among the children in St. Moritz and Herisau, those groups with\nthe lower number of cavities per person were using milk more or less\nliberally. Of the total number of children examined in both places only\n11 per cent were using milk in their diets, whereas 100 per cent of the\nchildren in the other districts that provided immunity were using milk.\nNearly every child in St. Moritz was eating white bread. In Herisau,\nall but one of the children examined were eating white bread in whole\nor in principal part.Since so many cattle were stall-fed in the thickly populated\npart of Switzerland, and since so low a proportion of the children used\nmilk even sparingly, I was concerned to know what use was made of the\nmilk. Numerous road signs announcing the brand of sweetened milk\nchocolate made in the several districts suggested one use. This\nchocolate is one of the important products for export and as a beverage\nconstitutes a considerable item in the nutrition of large numbers\nliving in this and in other countries. It is recognized as a high\nsource of energy, primarily because of the sugar and chocolate which\nwhen combined with the milk greatly reduces the ratio of the minerals\nto the energy factors as expressed in calories.It was formerly thought that dental caries which was so rampant\nin the greater portion of Switzerland was due in part to low iodine\ncontent in the cattle feed and in other food because of iodine\ndeficiency in the soil. Large numbers of former generations suffered\nfrom clinical goiter and various forms of thyroid disturbances. That\nthis is not the cause seems clearly demonstrated by the fact that\ndental caries is apparently as extensive today as ever before, if not\nmore so, while the iodine problem has been met through a reinforcement\nof the diet of growing children and others in stress periods with\niodine in suitable form. Indeed the early work done in Cleveland by\nCrile, Marine, and Kimball was referred to by the medical authorities\nthere as being the forerunner of the control of the thyroid disorder in\nthese communities.The officials of the Herisau community were so deeply concerned\nregarding the prevalence of dental caries that they were carrying\nforward institutional and community programs with the hope of checking\nthis affliction. If dental caries were primarily the result of an\ninadequate amount of vitamin D, then sunning the patients should\nprovide an adequate reinforcement. This is one of the principal\npurposes for getting the growing boys and girls of the community into\nsunsuits for tanning their bodies.Another procedure to which my attention was called consisted of\nadding to the bread a product high in lime, which was being obtained in\nthe foothills of the district. This and other types of bread were\nstudied by chemical analyses. Clinically, tooth decay was not\nreduced.I made an effort to establish a clinic in a neighboring town for\nthe purpose of demonstrating with a group of children that dental\ncaries can be controlled by a simple nutritional program. An\ninteresting incident developed in connection with the selection of the\nchildren for this experimental group. When parents were asked to permit\ntheir children to have one meal a day reinforced, according to a\nprogram that has proved adequate with my clinical groups in Cleveland,\nthe objection was made that there was no use trying to save the teeth\nof the girls. The girls should have all their teeth extracted and\nartificial teeth provided before they were married, because if they did\nnot they would lose them then.It is of interest that the southern part of Switzerland including\nthe high Alpine country is largely granite. The hills in the northern\npart of Switzerland are largely limestone in origin. A great number of\npeople live in the plain between these two geologic formations, a plain\nwhich is largely made of alluvial deposits which have been washed down\nfrom the upper formations. The soil is extraordinarily fertile soil and\nhas supported a thrifty and healthy population in the past.When I asked a government official what the principal diseases\nof the community were, he said that the most serious and most universal\nwas dental caries, and the next most important, tuberculosis; and that\nboth were largely modern diseases in that country.When I visited the famous advocate of heliotherapy, Dr. Rollier,\nin his clinic in Leysin, Switzerland, I wondered at the remarkable\nresults he was obtaining with heliotherapy in nonpulmonary\ntuberculosis. I asked him how many patients he had under his general\nsupervision and he said about thirty-five hundred. I then asked him how\nmany of them come from the isolated Alpine valleys and he said that\nthere was not one; but that they were practically all from the Swiss\nplains, with some from other countries.I inquired of several clinicians in Switzerland what their\nobservations were with regard to the association of dental caries and\ntuberculosis among the people of Switzerland. I noted that the reports\nindicated that the two diseases were generally associated. We will find\na corollary to this in many studies in other parts of the world.These studies in Switzerland, as briefly presented here, seem to\ndemonstrate that the isolated groups dependent on locally produced\nnatural foods have nearly complete natural immunity to dental caries,\nand that the substitution of modern dietaries for these primitive\nnatural foods destroys this immunity whether in ideally located\nelevated districts like St. Moritz or in the beautiful and fertile\nplains of lower Switzerland. The question seems to answer itself in a\ngeneral way, without much laboratory data, from the results of a\ncritical examination of the foods. The laboratory analyses, however,\nidentify the particular factors in the foods which are primarily\nresponsible by their presence for establishing immunity, and by their\nabsence in inducing susceptibility to dental caries. These chemical\ndata are discussed in Chapter 15.High immunity to dental caries, freedom from deformity of the\ndental arches and face, and sturdy physiques with high immunity to\ndisease were all found associated with physical isolation, and with\nforced limitation in selection of foods. This resulted in a very\nliberal use of dairy products and whole-rye bread, in connection with\nplant foods, and with meat served about once a week.The individuals in the modernized districts were found to have\nwidespread tooth decay. Many had facial and dental arch deformities and\nmuch susceptibility to diseases. These conditions were associated with\nthe use of refined cereal flours, a high intake of sweets, canned\ngoods, sweetened fruits, chocolate; and a greatly reduced use of dairy\nproducts.TABLE OF CONTENTSChapter 4ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED\nGAELICSSTORIES have long been told of the superb\nhealth of the people living in the Islands of the Outer Hebrides. The\nsmoke oozing through the thatched roofs of their \"black houses\" has\nadded weirdness to the description of their home life and strange\nenvironment. These stories have included a description of their\nwonderfully fine teeth and their stalwart physiques and strong\ncharacters. They, accordingly, provide an excellent setting for a study\nto throw light on the problem of the cause of dental caries and modern\nphysical degeneration. These Islands lie off the northwest coast of\nScotland, extending to a latitude nearly as far north as the southern\npart of Greenland. A typical view of their thatched-roof cottages may\nbe seen in Fig. 5.FIG. 5. A typical \"black house\"\nof the Isle of Lewis derives its name from the smoke of the peat burned\nfor heat. The splendid physical development of the native Gaelic\nfisherfolk is characterized by excellent teeth and well formed faces\nand dental arches.The Isle of Lewis has a population of about twenty thousand,\nmade up almost entirely of fisher folk and crofters or sheep raisers.\nThis island has so little lime in its soil that it is said that there\nare no trees in the entire island except a few which have been planted.\nThe surface of the island is largely covered with peat, varying in\nthickness from a few inches to twenty feet. This is the fuel. Peat\ncontains the rootlets of the plant life which grew many centuries ago.\nThere is so little bacterial growth that vegetable products undergo\nvery slow decay. The pasturage of the island is so poor that\nexceedingly few cattle are to be found, largely because they do not\nproperly mature and reproduce. In a few districts some highland cattle\nwith long shaggy hair and wide spread horns are found. Almost all of\nthese are imported. The principal herd of cattle on the island consists\nof a few dozen head on the government experimental farm.The basic foods of these islanders are fish and oat products\nwith a little barley. Oat grain is the one cereal which develops fairly\nreadily, and it provides the porridge and oat cakes which in many homes\nare eaten in some form regularly with each meal. The fishing about the\nOuter Hebrides is specially favorable, and small sea foods, including\nlobsters, crabs, oysters and clams, are abundant. An important and\nhighly relished article of diet has been baked cod's head stuffed with\nchopped cod's liver and oatmeal. The principal port of the Isle of\nLewis is Stornoway with a fixed population of about four thousand and a\nfloating population of seamen over week-ends, of an equal or greater\nnumber. The Sunday we spent there, 450 large fishing boats were said to\nbe in the port for the week-end. Large quantities of fish are packed\nhere for foreign markets. These hardy fisherwomen often toil from six\nin the morning to ten at night. The abundance of fish makes the cost of\nliving very low.In Fig. 5 may be seen three of these fisher-people with teeth of\nunusual perfection. We saw them at the fish-cleaning benches from early\nmorning till late at night dressed, as you see them pictured, in their\noilskin suits and rubber boots. We met them again in their Sunday\nattire taking important parts in the leading church. It would be\ndifficult to find examples of womanhood combining a higher degree of\nphysical perfection and more exalted ideals than these weather-hardened\ntoilers. Theirs is a land of frequent gales, often sleet-ridden or\nenshrouded in penetrating cold fogs. Life is full of meaning for\ncharacters that are developed to accept as everyday routine raging seas\nand piercing blizzards representing the accumulated fury of the\ntreacherous north Atlantic. One marvels at their gentleness, refinement\nand sweetness of character.The people live in these so-called black houses. These are\nthatched-roof dwellings containing usually two or three rooms. The\nwalls are built of stone and dirt, ordinarily about five feet in\nthickness. There is usually a fireplace and chimney, one or two outside\ndoors, and very few windows in the house. The thatch of the roofs plays\na very important rôle. It is replaced each October and the old\nthatch is believed by the natives to have great value as a special\nfertilizer for their soil because of its impregnation with chemicals\nthat have been obtained from the peat smoke which may be seen seeping\nthrough all parts of the roof at all seasons of the year. Peat fires\nare kept burning for this explicit purpose even when the heat is not\nneeded. This means that enormous quantities of peat are required to\nmaintain a continuous smudge. Some of the houses have no chimney\nbecause it is desirable that the smoke leave the building through the\nthatched roof. Not infrequently smoke is seen rolling out of an open\ndoor or open window. Fortunately the peat is so abundant that it can be\nobtained easily from the almost limitless quantities nearby. The sheep\nthat roam the heather-covered plains are of a small black-faced breed,\nexhibiting great hardihood. They provide wool of specially high\nquality, which, incidentally, is the source of the famous Harris Tweeds\nwhich are woven in these small black houses chiefly on the Isle of\nHarris.We are particularly concerned with the people of early Scotch\ndescent who possess a physique that rivals that found in almost any\nplace in the world. They are descendants of the original Gaelic stock\nwhich is their language today, and the only one which a large\npercentage of them can speak. This island has only one port which means\nthat most of the shore line still provides primitive living conditions\nas does the central part of the island. It was a great surprise, and\nindeed a very happy one, to find such high types of manhood and\nwomanhood as exist among the occupants of these rustic thatched-roof\nhomes, usually located in an expanse of heather-covered treeless\nplains. It would be hard to visualize a more complete isolation for\nchild life than many of these homes provide, and one marvels at the\nrefinement, intelligence, and strength of character of these rugged\npeople. They resent, and I think justly so, the critical and\nuncomplimentary references made to their homes in attaching to them the\nname \"black-houses.\" Several that we visited were artistically\ndecorated with clean wallpaper and improvised hangings.One would expect that in their one seaport town of Stornoway\nthings would be gay over the week-end, if not boisterous, with between\nfour and five thousand fishermen and seamen on shore-leave from\nSaturday until midnight Sunday. On Saturday evening the sidewalks were\ncrowded with happy carefree people, but no boisterousness and no\ndrinking were to be seen. Sunday the people went in throngs to their\nvarious churches. Before the sailors went aboard their crafts on Sunday\nevening they met in bands on the street and on the piers for religious\nsinging and prayers for safety on their next fishing expedition. One\ncould not buy a postage stamp, a picture card, or a newspaper, could\nnot hire a taxi, and could not find a place of amusement open on\nSunday. Everybody has reverence for the Sabbath day on the Isle of\nLewis. Every activity is made subservient to their observance of the\nSabbath day. In few places in the world are moral standards so high.\nOne wonders if the bleak winds which thrash the north Atlantic from our\nLabrador and Greenland coasts have not tempered the souls of these\npeople and created in them higher levels of nobility and exalted human\nexpression. These people are the outposts of the western fringe of the\nEuropean continent.Just as one sees in Brittany, on the west coast of France, the\nprehistoric druidical stone forest marking a civilization which existed\nso far in the past as to be without historic records except in its\nmonuments; so, too, we find here the forest of granite slabs in which\nthese sturdy prehistoric souls worshipped their divinities before they\nwere crowded into the sea by the westward moving hordes. When one\nrealizes the distance that these heavy stones had to be transported, a\ndistance of probably twenty miles over difficult terrain, we can\nappreciate the task. Their size can be calculated from the depth to\nwhich they must be buried in order to stand erect even to this day.We are concerned primarily with the physical development of the\npeople, and particularly with their freedom from dental caries or tooth\ndecay. One has only to see them carrying their burdens of peat or to\nobserve the ease with which the fisherwomen on the docks carry their\ntubs of fish back from the cleaning table to the tiers of packing\nbarrels to be convinced that these people have not only been trained to\nwork, but have physiques equal to the task. These studies included the\nmaking of dental examinations, the taking of photographs, the obtaining\nof samples of saliva for chemical analysis, the gathering of detailed\nclinical records, and the collecting of samples of food for chemical\nanalysis and detailed nutritional data.Communication is very difficult among many of these islands. It\nwould be difficult to find more complete isolation than some of them\nafford. We tried to get to the islands of Taransay and Scarpa on the\nwest coast of the Isle of Harris, but were unable to obtain\ntransportation since the trip can be made only in special, seaworthy\ncrafts, which will undertake the passage only at certain phases of the\ntide and at certain directions of the winds. On one of these islands,\nwe were told, the growing boys and girls had exceedingly high immunity\nto tooth decay. Their isolation was so great that a young woman of\nabout twenty years of age who came to the Isle of Harris from Taransay\nIsland had never seen milk in any larger quantity than drops. There are\nno dairy animals on that island. Their nutrition is provided by their\noat products and fish, and by a very limited amount of vegetable foods.\nLobsters and flat fish are a very important part of their foods. Fruits\nare practically unknown. Yet the physiques of these people are\nremarkably fine.It was necessary sometimes for us to engage skilled seamen and\ntheir crafts to make a special trip to some of these isolated islands.\nThese seamen watch critically the tide, wind and sky, and determine the\nlength of time it will be safe to travel in a certain direction under\nconditions existing in the speed of the running tide and the periodic\nchange of the wind. Some of the islands are isolated by severe weather\nconditions for many months of the year.These islands have been important in the whaling industry, even\nup to recent years. We visited a whaling station on the Isle of Harris,\nnot active at this time, where monsters of the sea were towed into a\ndeep bay.In the interior of the Isle of Lewis the teeth of the growing\nboys and girls had a very high degree of perfection, with only 1.3\nteeth out of every hundred examined that had even been attacked by\ndental caries.An important part of the study of these islands was the\nobservations made on conditions at the fringe of civilization. A\ntypical cross-section of the residents of the seaport town of Stornoway\ncan be seen assembled on the docks to greet the arrival of the evening\nboat, the principal event of the community. The group consists largely\nof adult young people. In a count of one hundred individuals appearing\nto be between the ages of twenty and forty, twenty-five were already\nwearing artificial teeth, and as many more would have been more\npresentable had they too been so equipped. Dental caries was very\nextensive in the modernized section of Stornoway. Since an important\npart of these studies involved a determination of the kinds and\nquantities of foods eaten, it was necessary to visit the sources\navailable for purchasing foods in each town studied. In Stornoway, one\ncould purchase angel food cake, white bread, as snow white as that to\nbe found in any community in the world, many other white-flour\nproducts; also, canned marmalades, canned vegetables, sweetened fruit\njuices, jams, confections of every type filled the store windows and\ncounters. These foods probably made a great appeal both because of\ntheir variety and their high sugar content to the pallets of these\nprimitive people. The difference in physical appearance of the child\nlife of Stornoway from that of the interior of the Isle of Lewis was\nstriking. We found a family on the opposite coast of the island where\nthe two boys shown in the upper half of Fig. 6 resided. One had\nexcellent teeth and the other had rampant caries. These boys were\nbrothers eating at the same table. The older boy, with excellent teeth,\nwas still enjoying primitive food of oatmeal and oatcake and sea foods\nwith some limited dairy products. The younger boy, seen to the left,\nhad extensive tooth decay. Many teeth were missing including two in the\nfront. He insisted on having white bread, jam, highly sweetened coffee\nand also sweet chocolates. His father told me with deep concern how\ndifficult it was for this boy to get up in the morning and go to\nwork.FIG. 6. Above: brothers, Isle\nof Harris. The younger at left uses modern food and has rampant tooth\ndecay. Brother at right uses native food and has excellent teeth. Note\nnarrowed face and arch of younger brother. Below: typical rampant tooth\ndecay, modernized Gaelic. Right: typical excellent teeth of primitive\nGaelic.One of the sad stories of the Isle of Lewis has to do with the\nrecent rapid progress of the white plague. The younger generation of\nthe modernized part of the Isle of Lewis is not showing the same\nresistance to tuberculosis as their ancestors. Indeed a special\nhospital has been built at Stornoway for the rapidly increasing number\nof tubercular patients, particularly for girls between twenty and\nthirty years of age. The superintendent told me with deep concern of\nthe rapidity with which this menace is growing. Apparently very little\nconsideration was being given to the change in nutrition as a possible\nexplanation for the failure of this generation to show the defense of\nprevious generations against pulmonary tuberculosis. In this connection\nmuch blame had been placed upon the housing conditions, it being\nthought that the thatched-roof house with its smoke-laden air was an\nimportant contributing factor, notwithstanding the fact that former\ngenerations had been free from the disease. I was told that the\nincidence of tuberculosis was frequently the same in the modern homes\nas it was in the thatched-roof homes. It was of special interest to\nobserve the mental attitude of the native with regard to the\nthatched-roof house. Again and again, we saw the new house built beside\nthe old one, and the people apparently living in the new one, but still\nkeeping the smoke smudging through the thatch of the old thatched-roof\nhouse. When I inquired regarding this I was told by one of the\nclearthinking residents that this thatch collected something from the\nsmoke which when put in the soil doubled the growth of plants and yield\nof grain. He showed me with keen interest two patches of grain which\nseemed to demonstrate the soundness of his contention.I was particularly interested in studying the growing boys and\ngirls at a place called Scalpay in the Isle of Harris. This Island is\nvery rocky and has only small patches of soil for available pasturage.\nFor nutrition, the children of this community were dependent very\nlargely on oatmeal porridge, oatcake and sea foods. An examination of\nthe growing boys and girls disclosed the fact that only one tooth out\nof every hundred examined had ever been attacked by tooth decay. The\ngeneral physical development of these children was excellent, as may be\nseen in the upper half of Fig. 7. Note their broad faces.FIG. 7. Above: typical rugged\nGaelic children, Isle of Harris, living on oats and sea food. Note the\nbreadth of the faces and nostrils. Below: typical modernized Gaelics,\nIsle of Bardsey. Note narrowed faces and nostrils.This is in striking contrast with the children of the hamlet of\nTarbert which is the only shipping port on the Isle of Harris, and the\nplace of export of most of the famous Harris tweeds which are\nmanufactured on looms in the various crofters' homes. These Tarbert\nchildren had an incidence of 32.4 carious teeth out of every hundred\nteeth examined. The distance between these two points is not over ten\nmiles and both have equal facilities for obtaining sea foods, being on\nthe coast. Only the latter, however, has access to modern foods, since\nit supports a white bread bakery store with modern jams, marmalades,\nand other kinds of canned foods. In studying the tragedy of the rampant\ntooth decay in the mouth of a young man, I asked him regarding his\nplans and he stated that he was expecting to go to Stornoway about\nsixty miles away in the near future, where there was a dentist, and\nhave all his teeth extracted and plates made. He said that it was no\nuse to have any teeth filled, that he would have to lose them anyway\nsince that was everybody's experience in Tarbert. The young women were\nin just as poor a condition.Through the department of dental inspection for north Scotland,\nI learned of a place on the Isle of Skye, Airth of Sleat, in which only\na few years ago there were thirty-six children in the school, and not\none case of dental caries in the group. My examination of the children\nin this community disclosed two groups, one living exclusively on\nmodern foods, and the other on primitive foods. Those living on\nprimitive foods had only 0.7 carious teeth per hundred, while those in\nthe group living on modern foods had 16.3, or twenty-three times as\nmany.This community living near the sea had recently been connected\nwith the outside world by daily steamboat service which delivered to\nthe people modern foods of various kinds, and within this community a\nmodern bakery, and a supply house for purchasing the canned vegetables,\njams and marmalades had been established. This district was just in the\nprocess of being modernized.I examined teeth of several people in the seventies and\neighties, and except for gingival infections with some loosening of the\nteeth, nearly all of the teeth were present and there was very little\nevidence that dental caries had ever existed. The elderly people were\nbemoaning the fact that the generation that was growing up had not the\nhealth of former generations. I asked what their explanation was and\nthey pointed to two stone grinding mills which they said had ground the\noats for oatcake and porridge for their families and preceding families\nfor hundreds of years. Though they prized them highly, the plea that\nthey would be helpful in educational work in America induced them to\nsell the mills to me. They told us with great concern of the recent\nrapid decline in health of the young people of this district.This one-time well-populated Island, the misty Isle of Skye,\nstill has one of the finest of the famous old castles, that belonging\nto the Dunvegan clan. It participated in the romantic life of Prince\nCharlie. The castle equipment still boasts the grandeur of a past\nglory. Among the relics is a horn which measured the draft to be drunk\nby a prospective chieftain before he could aspire to the leadership of\nthe clan. He must drink its contents of two quarts without stopping.\nAgain the character of that manhood is reflected in the fact that\nalthough a bounty of thirty thousand pounds was placed upon the head of\nPrince Charlie, none of the many who knew his place of hiding betrayed\nit.On my return from the Outer Hebrides to Scotland, I was\nconcerned to obtain information from government officials relative to\nthe incidence of tooth decay and the degenerative diseases in various\nparts of north Scotland. I was advised that in the last fifty years the\naverage height of Scotch men in some parts decreased four inches, and\nthat this had been coincident with the general change from high\nimmunity to dental caries to a loss of immunity in a great part of this\ngeneral district. A study of the market places revealed that a large\npart of the nutrition was shipped into the district in the form of\nrefined flours and canned goods and sugar. There were very few herds of\ndairy cattle to be seen. It was explained that even the highland cattle\ndid not do as well as formerly on the same ranges.As one proceeds from the north of Scotland southward to England\nand Wales, there is a marked increase in the percentage of individuals\nwearing artificial restorations or in need of them. In several\ncommunities this reached fifty per cent of adults over thirty years of\nage. An effort was made to find primitive people in the high country of\nWales, but without success. We were advised that about the only place\nthat we would be likely to find people living under primitive\nconditions would be on the Island of Bardsey off the northwest coast of\nWales. This is a rock and storm-bound island with the decadent walls of\nan old castle and a community made up largely of recently imported\ncolonists whom we were advised had been taken to the Island to\nre-populate it. There is considerable good farm land, but very limited\ngrazing stock. Formerly the Island had produced the foods for its\ninhabitants with the assistance of the sea. These sources of natural\nfoods have been largely displaced with imported white flour,\nmarmalades, sugar, jams and canned goods. We found the physical\ncondition of the people very poor, particularly that of the growing\nboys and girls. Tooth decay was so wide-spread that 27.6 out of every\nhundred teeth examined in the growing boys and girls had already been\nattacked by dental caries. It was even active in three year olds. From\na conference with the director of public health of this district I\nlearned that tuberculosis constituted a very great problem, not only\nfor the people on this island, but for those of many districts of\nnorthern Wales. This was ascribed to the lowered defense of the people\ndue to causes unknown. It had been noted that individuals with rampant\ntooth decay were more susceptible to pulmonary tuberculosis.While on the Island of Bardsey, I inquired as to what they\nthought was the cause of such extensive tooth decay as we found, and\nwas told that they were familiar with the cause and that it was due to\nclose contact with the salt water and salt air. When I asked why many\nof the old people who had lived by the sea all their lives in some\ndistricts still had practically all their teeth and had never had tooth\ndecay, no explanation was available. This they said was the reason that\nhad been given in answer to their inquiries.There is a very remarkable history written in the ruins of the\nisland, and in the faces of the people who live on the Island of\nBardsey. The rugged walls of ancient castles bespeak the glory and\npower of the people who lived proudly in past centuries. They are\ntestified to also by the monuments in the cemeteries; but a new era has\ncome to this island. The director of public health, of this district of\nWales, including Bardsey Island, told me the story of the decline and\nalmost complete extinction of the population due to tuberculosis. He\nalso told how the government had re-populated the Island with fifty\nhealthy young families, and then the sad story of how these new\nsettlers were breaking down as rapidly as the former occupants.The lower photograph in Fig. 7 is of a family of four children\nin whose faces the tragic story is deeply written. Everyone is a mouth\nbreather and everyone has rampant tooth decay. These people are\nproducts of modernization on this island which one time produced\nvigorous children and stalwart men and women. It is important to\ncompare the faces of the children of the Isle of Bardsey shown in Fig.\n7 below with those shown in Fig. 7 above living in an isolated district\nin the Isle of Harris. As we will see later, the facial deformity does\nnot reach its maximum severity until the eruption of the second\ndentition and the development of the adult face, usually at from nine\nto fourteen years of age. In cases of extreme injury, however, we find\nit appearing in the childhood face during the period of temporary or\ndeciduous dentition. These children will, doubtless, be much more\nseriously deformed when their permanent dentitions and adult faces\ndevelop. It is important for us to keep this picture in mind in its\nrelation to the high incidence of tuberculosis as we read succeeding\nchapters and find the part played by modernization in breaking down the\ndefense of individuals to infective processes including\ntuberculosis.In Fig. 6 (lower left) is a young girl from the Isle of Bardsey.\nShe is about seventeen years of age. Her teeth were wrecked with dental\ncaries, the disease involving even the front teeth. We ate a meal at\nthe home in which she was living. It consisted of white bread, butter\nand jam, all imported to the island. This is in striking contrast with\nthe picture of the girl shown in Fig. 6 (lower right) living in the\nIsle of Lewis, in the central area. She has splendidly formed dental\narches and a high immunity to tooth decay. Her diet and that of her\nparents was oatmeal porridge and oatcake and fish which built stalwart\npeople. The change in the two generations was illustrated by a little\ngirl and her grandfather on the Isle of Skye. He was the product of the\nold régime, and about eighty years of age. He was carrying the\nharvest from the fields on his back when I stopped him to take his\npicture. He was typical of the stalwart product raised on the native\nfoods. His granddaughter had pinched nostrils and narrowed face. Her\ndental arches were deformed and her teeth crowded. She was a mouth\nbreather. She had the typical expression of the result of modernization\nafter the parents had adopted the modern foods of commerce, and\nabandoned the oatcake, oatmeal porridge and sea foods.FIG. 8. From left to right.\nThese pots of soil growing oats contained decreasing amounts of\nsmoke-thatch. Only the first produced mature grain. This is in accord\nwith the belief and practice of the native Gaelics.Since a fundamental part of this study involves an examination\nof the accumulated wisdom of the primitive racial stocks, it is\nimportant that we look further into the matter of the smoked thatch. I\nwas advised by the old residents that a serious conflict existed\nbetween them and the health officials who came from outside to their\nisland. The latter blamed the smoke for the sudden development of\ntuberculosis in acute form, and they insisted that the old procedure be\nentirely discontinued. For this purpose the government gave very\nsubstantial assistance in the building of new and modern homes. The\nexperienced natives contended that the oat crop would not mature in\nthat severe climate without being fertilized with the smoked thatch.\nWhile they were willing to move into the new house, they were not\nwilling to give up the smoking of the oat straw used for the thatch to\nprepare it for fertilizing the ground. I brought some of this smoked\nthatch with me both for chemical analysis and for testing for the\ninfluence on plant growth. This was done by adding different quantities\nof the smoked thatch to a series of pots in which oat seeds were\nplanted. In Fig. 8 will be seen the result. The pot to the right shows\nthe result of planting the oats in a sandy soil almost like that of the\nIslands of the Outer Hebrides. The oats only grew to the fuzzy limited\ncondition shown. As increasing amounts of this thatch were added to the\nsoil, there was an increase in the ruggedness of the plants so that in\nthe last pot to the left tall stalks were developed heavily loaded with\ngrain which ripened by the time the growth shown in the other pots had\noccurred. The chemical analysis of the thatch showed that it contained\na quantity of fixed nitrogen and other chemicals resulting from the\npeat smoke circulating through the thatch. This explains the confidence\nof the hardy old natives who insisted on being permitted to continue\nthe smoking of the thatch even though they did not live in the\nhouse.A dietary program competent to build stalwart men and women and\nrugged boys and girls is provided the residents of these barren\nIslands, with their wind and storm-swept coasts, by a diet of oats used\nas oatcake and oatmeal porridge; together with fish products, including\nsome fish organs and eggs. A seriously degenerated stock followed the\ndisplacement of this diet with a typical modern diet consisting of\nwhite bread, sugar, jams, syrup, chocolate, coffee, some fish without\nlivers, canned vegetables, and eggs.Key to Location of Indian and\nEskimo Groups Examined in Canada1.

Kokamute, AlaskaTABLE OF CONTENTSChapter 5ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED\nESKIMOSDURING the rise and fall of historic and\nprehistoric cultures that have often left their monuments and arts\nfollowing each other in succession in the same location, one culture,\nthe Eskimo, living on until today, brings us a robust sample of the\nStone Age people. The Maya race is gone, but has left its monuments.\nThe Indian race is rapidly changing or disappearing in North America.\nThe Eskimo race has remained true to ancestral type to give us a living\ndemonstration of what Nature can do in the building of a race competent\nto withstand for thousands of years the rigors of an Arctic climate.\nLike the Indian, the Eskimo thrived as long as he was not blighted by\nthe touch of modern civilization, but with it, like all primitives, he\nwithers and dies.In his primitive state he has provided an example of physical\nexcellence and dental perfection such as has seldom been excelled by\nany race in the past or present. We are concerned to know the secret of\nthis great achievement since his circumscribed life greatly reduces the\nfactors that may enter as controlling units in molding this excellence.\nWhile we are primarily concerned in this study with the characteristics\nof the Eskimo dentition and facial form and the effect upon it of his\ncontact with modern civilization, we are also deeply concerned to know\nthe formula of his nutrition in order that we may learn from it the\nsecrets that will not only aid the unfortunate modern or so-called\ncivilized races, but will also, if possible, provide means for\nassisting in their preservation.It is a sad commentary that with the coming of the white man the\nEskimos and Indians are rapidly reduced both in numbers and physical\nexcellence by the white man's diseases. We have few problems more\nurgent or more challenging than that means shall soon be found for\npreventing the extermination of the primitive Americans. Many reports\nhave been made with regard to the condition of the teeth of the\nEskimos. Doubtless, all have been relatively authentic for the groups\nstudied, which have been chiefly along the routes of commerce. Clearly\nthose people would not represent the most primitive groups, which could\nonly be located beyond the reach of contact with modern civilization.\nThe problems involved strongly suggested the desirability of locating\nand studying Eskimos in isolated districts. While dog teams could\nfurnish means of approach in the winter season, they would not be\navailable for summer travel.Through the kindness of Dr. Alexis Hrdlicka, who has made\nanthropological studies of the Eskimos in many of the districts of\nAlaska, I learned that the most primitive groups were located south of\nthe Yukon in the country between it and Bristol Bay including the Delta\nand mouth of the Kuskokwim River. A government station has been\nestablished on the Kuskokwim River for which a government boat enters\nthe mouth of the Kuskokwim to deliver supplies. It carries officials,\nbut not passengers. This contact with civilization has made available\nmodern foods for a limited district, chiefly at the point at which the\nboat lands, namely, Bethel. A portion of these supplies is transported\nby a stern-wheel river boat to settlements farther up the river. A\ngreat number, however, of Eskimos live between the mouth of the\nKuskokwim and the mouth of the Yukon River, on the mainland and\nislands, a distance of several hundred miles, and have little or no\ncontact with this food.Accordingly, our program for making these field studies among\nthe Eskimos in 1933 required transportation over long distances and\ninto districts where travelling facilities were practically\nnon-existent by other means than by modern aeroplane. Mrs. Price\naccompanies and assists me with my records. Our itinerary included\nsteamship service to Seward in western Alaska and railway to Anchorage,\nwhere an aeroplane was chartered which carried us to various districts\nin western and central Alaska. This plane carried our field equipment,\nand travelled to the points selected. The great Alaska mountain range,\nculminating in the magnificent Mt. McKinley, stretches across Alaska\nfrom the Aleutian Peninsula at the southwest far into the heart of this\nvast territory. The highest mountain in the United States proper is Mt.\nWhitney, 14,502 feet. The highest mountain in Canada is Mt. Logan,\n19,539 feet. Alaska, however, boasts many mountains that are higher\nthan any of these, many of which are in this range. Mt. McKinley is\n20,300 feet. It was necessary for us to surmount this magnificent range\nto reach the territory in which our investigations were to be made. The\nspecial aeroplane selected was equipped with radio for both sending and\nreceiving, and was in touch, or could be in touch at all times, with\nthe Signal Service Corps, as well as with the headquarters and branches\nof the Company. Owing to clouds in the selected pass, the pilot found\nit necessary to go one hundred fifty miles out of his course to find\none that was clear enough to fly through. Beyond these mountains were\nvast areas of bare wilderness with no signs of human life. Moose were\nfrequently seen.Our first objective was to find, if possible, a band of Indians\nreported to live on Stony River. They had been described as being very\nprimitive. Our pilot, who was well informed about this region, said\nthis was the first time he had even landed in this district. All the\npeople were busy catching and storing the running salmon. After drying\nthe fish they are smoked for a few hours and then stored for winter\nuse. These thrifty people have physical features quite unlike the\nIndians of central, southern and eastern Alaska. Of the twelve\nindividuals studied here, ten had lived entirely on the native foods or\npractically so. In their 288 teeth only one tooth was found that had\never been attacked by tooth decay, or 0.3 per cent. Two had come up\nfrom the Kuskokwim River, of which the Stony River is a branch. There,\nthey had received a considerable quantity of the \"store grub\" that had\nbeen shipped up the Kuskokwim from Bethel. Twenty-seven per cent of the\nteeth of these two had been attacked by dental caries.We then proceeded to Sleet Mute, on the Kuskokwim River, where\nthree individuals were found who had lived entirely on native foods.\nNone of them had ever had a tooth attacked by tooth decay. Seven others\nhad lived partly on native foods and partly on \"store grub,\" and they\nhad dental caries in 12.2 per cent of their teeth.At Crooked Creek, the next settlement, eight individuals were\nexamined and of their 216 teeth forty-one, or 18.9 per cent, had\ncaries. All but one of these were living in considerable part on \"store\ngrub,\" and this individual had no dental caries.At Napimute, 16 per cent of the teeth had been attacked by\ndental caries, but no individuals studied here were living entirely on\nnative foods.Bethel is the largest settlement on the Kuskokwim, and contains\nin addition to the white residents many visiting Eskimos from the\nnearby Tundra country surrounding it. Eighty-eight individuals studied\nhere were largely Eskimos and mixed bloods. Of their 2,490 teeth, 11.6\nper cent, or 281 teeth, had been attacked by tooth decay. Of these\neighty-eight individuals twenty-seven with 796 teeth had lived almost\nexclusively on natural foods, and in this group only one tooth was\nfound with dental caries, or 0.1 per cent. Forty individuals were\nliving almost exclusively on modern foods as shipped in by the\ngovernment supply boat. Of their 1,094 teeth, 252, or 21.1 per cent,\nhad been attacked by tooth decay. Twenty-one individuals were living\npartly on native foods and partly on \"store grub,\" and of their 600\nteeth thirty-eight, or 6.3 per cent, had been attacked by tooth\ndecay.At Kokamute, on the Bering Sea at the mouth of the Kuskokwim\nRiver, a large band of very primitive Eskimos was studied. They had\ncome from the vicinity of Nelson Island, a district which has had\nexceedingly little contact with modern civilization. In this group\ntwenty-eight individuals with 820 teeth showed only one tooth, or 0.1\nper cent, that had ever been attacked by dental caries.Bethel Island is situated in the Kuskokwim River. It is visited\nin the summer by Eskimos from the Tundra Country for laying in their\nstore of fish for winter use. Of fifteen individuals here, thirteen,\nwith 410 teeth, had lived exclusively on native foods, and not a single\ntooth had been attacked by dental caries. Two had come from Bethel, and\nof their sixty teeth twenty-one or 35 per cent had been attacked by\ntooth decay.In the various groups in the lower Kuskokwim seventy-two\nindividuals who were living exclusively on native foods had in their\n2,138 teeth only two teeth or 0.09 per cent that had ever been attacked\nby tooth decay. In this district eighty-one individuals were studied\nwho had been living in part or in considerable part on modern foods,\nand of their 2,254 teeth 394 or 13 per cent had been attacked by dental\ncaries. This represents an increase in dental caries of 144 fold.It next became desirable to study a district that had been in\ncontact with the foods of modern commerce for many years, and for this\nHoly Cross was selected. This community is located on the Yukon River\nabove the Arctic Circle. It has been in contact with the summer\ncommerce of the Yukon for several decades. It has one of the oldest and\nbest organized Catholic Missions of Alaska. The individuals studied\nwere all in the school connected with the Mission. The students had\ncome from as far north as Point Barrow on the Arctic Ocean and west to\nthe Bering Straits. All but one had been in contact with and had used\nmodern foods before coming to the Mission, and were using them while\nthere. This one individual had lived exclusively on native foods before\ncoming to the Mission and he had no carious teeth. In eight individuals\nwith 224 teeth, who had lived very largely on modern foods, forty-two\nteeth or 18.7 per cent had been attacked by tooth decay. Four\nindividuals had lived partly on native foods and partly on modern\nfoods, and of their 112 teeth four, or 3.5 per cent, had been attacked\nby tooth decay.It is of interest that while the Eskimos and Indians have lived\nin accord, they have not intermarried. The Eskimos occupy the lower\nsection of the Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers, and the Bering Sea frontier.\nThe Indians have occupied the Upper waterways of both these rivers. The\nnext place selected for study was McGrath, which is on the Upper\nKuskokwim not far distant from the McKinley Mountain Range. It is the\nupper terminus of navigation on the Kuskokwim River for the stern-wheel\nriver boats. Its chief importance lies in the fact that it is the\ndivision point on the Cross Alaska Aeroplane Routes from Anchorage or\nFairbanks to Nome and other western points. Its population consists of\nseveral white prospectors and miners who have stayed in the country\nfollowing the gold rush. Some of them have married Indian and Eskimo\nwomen. Of twenty-one individuals only one had lived almost exclusively\non native foods and she had no dental caries. Twenty had lived chiefly\non imported foods, and of their 527 teeth 175, or 33.2 per cent, had\nbeen attacked by tooth decay.Among the residents of McGrath there is a remarkable family. The\nfather is an American mining engineer who has spent much of his life in\nthat country. His wife is a charming Eskimo woman of splendid\nintelligence and fine personality. She had come originally from the\nlower Kuskokwim and was one of the primitive Eskimo stock. While mining\ninterests had provided food supplies for the family, shipped from the\nUnited States, she followed her early training and insisted on catching\nand storing salmon in season as an important part of her own dietary.\nThe salmon were dried and smoked as was the custom of her people. She\nis the mother of at least twenty children, for she could give the names\nof that many. Only eleven were living, however, several having died\nfrom tuberculosis. Notwithstanding her many overloads, not a single\ntooth had ever been attacked by tooth decay. A lower anterior tooth had\nbeen broken. A picture of this woman is shown in Fig. 9 (upper, left).\nThere has been extensive wear of the teeth, as is characteristic of the\nteeth of many of the Eskimos, a matter which we will presently discuss.\nIt is of interest to note the splendid symmetry of her dental arches.\nHer children and husband and son-in-law had lived very largely on\nmodern foods and in these eight individuals with 212 teeth\neighty-seven, or 41 per cent, had been attacked by tooth decay. Her\noldest living daughter is twenty-two years of age. She has a narrowing\nof the upper arch and extensive tooth decay. Another daughter, sixteen,\nis a beautiful girl except for her narrow dental arches. She was\nreported by our pilot to have become so deeply interested in the\nengines of the aircrafts as they stopped at this point for servicing\nand fuel that she had become expert in tuning up and conditioning\naeroplane motors. She, doubtless, inherited some of the genius of her\nfather, who is a mining engineer. Twelve of her teeth had been attacked\nby dental caries.FIG. 9. Typical native Alaskan\nEskimos. Note the broad faces and broad arches and no dental caries\n(tooth decay). Upper left, woman has a broken lower tooth. She has had\ntwenty-six children with no tooth decay.One does not get a conception of the magnificent dental\ndevelopment of the more primitive Eskimos simply by learning that they\nhave freedom from dental caries. The size and strength of the mandible,\nthe breadth of the face and the strength of the muscles of mastication\nall reach a degree of excellence that is seldom seen in other races.\nThis is typically illustrated in Fig. 9. I was told that an average\nadult Eskimo man can carry one hundred pounds in each hand and one\nhundred pounds in his teeth with ease for a considerable distance. This\nillustrates the physical development of other parts of the body as well\nas the jaws, and suggests that the exercising of the jaws is not the\nsole reason for their very fine teeth, since the superb development of\nthe musculature includes all parts of the body. It has also been\nsuggested that chewing of tough foods, by building teeth of\nexceptionally fine quality, has been an important factor in the\nestablishment of immunity to caries. As will be shown presently, the\nteeth of these individuals with their excellent physical development\nand fine tooth structure develop caries when they depart from their\nnative foods and adopt our modern foods.Much has been reported in the literature of the excessive wear\nof the Eskimos' teeth, which in the case of the women has been ascribed\nto the chewing of the leather in the process of tanning. It is of\ninterest that while many of the teeth studied gave evidence of\nexcessive wear involving the crowns to a depth that in many individuals\nwould have exposed the pulps, there was in no case an open pulp\nchamber. They were always filled with secondary dentin. This is\nimportant since our newer knowledge indicates that with the chemical\ncharacteristics of their food we might expect that secondary dentin\nwould be readily formed within the pulp chambers by a process similar\nto that which occurs in many individuals under a diet reinforced with\nmineral and activator-providing foods. One old Eskimo had a scar on his\nlower lip, which was the result of perforations for carrying a\ndecoration as practiced by his tribe. I have found primitive tribes in\nseveral parts of the world with this marking.The principal outer garment worn by the Eskimo for the more\nprimitive groups consists of a parka carrying a hood which is pulled\nover the head and closed around the neck with a shirr string, while\nanother shirr string controls the size of the face opening in the hood\nwhen it is up. In the summer this is made of cloth or of skin without\nthe fur. A typical case is shown in Fig. 9. It will again be noted that\nthe teeth are excessively worn.FIG. 10. These primitive\nAlaskan mothers rear strong, rugged babies. The mothers do not suffer\nfrom dental caries.Owing to the bleakness of the winds off the Bering Sea, even in\nthe summer many of the women wear furs. A typical mother and child\ndressed in their warm clothing are shown in Fig. 10. The Eskimo women\nare both artistic and skillful in needle work. They use fur of\ndifferent colors for decorating their garments. These women make\nartistic decorations by carving ivory from walrus teeth and from the\nburied tusks of the hairy mammoth that wandered over the Tundra tens of\nthousands of years ago. The ear decoration of this Eskimo woman is a\ntypical design. This mother's teeth are literally \"two rows of pearls.\"\nIt is important to note the width of the arches. One is continually\nimpressed with the magnificent health of the child life which is\nillustrated in Fig. 10. In our various contacts with them we never\nheard an Eskimo child crying except when hungry, or frightened by the\npresence of strangers. The women are characterized by the abundance of\nbreastfood which almost always develops normally and is maintained\nwithout difficulty for a year. The mothers were completely free of\ndental caries, and I was told that the children of the Eskimos have no\ndifficulties with the cutting of their teeth.FIG. 11. When the primitive\nAlaskan Eskimos obtain the white man's foods, dental caries become\nactive. Pyorrhea also often becomes severe. In many districts dental\nservice cannot be obtained and suffering is acute and\nprolonged.The excellence of dentitions among the Eskimos has been a\ncharacteristic also of the skulls that have been excavated in various\nparts of Alaska.It might be expected that such wonderfully formed teeth would\nmaintain so high an immunity to dental caries that their proud\npossessors would never be troubled with tooth decay. This,\nunfortunately, is not the case, a fact of great significance in\nevaluating our modern theories of the causes of dental caries. When\nthese adult Eskimos exchange their foods for our modern foods, which we\nwill discuss in Chapter 15, they often have very extensive tooth decay\nand suffer severely. This is clearly illustrated in Fig. 11, for these\nEskimos' teeth had been seriously wrecked by tooth decay. They had been\nliving on modern foods and were typical of a large number who are in\ncontact with the Bering Sea ports. Their plight often becomes tragic\nsince there are no dentists in these districts.A typical effect of modernization on a growing girl was shown in\na case in which the central incisors and 16 other teeth were attacked\nby dental caries. Sixty-four per cent of her teeth had tooth decay.There are no dentists in western Alaska, north or west of\nAnchorage, which is near the southern coast, except at Fairbanks which,\nlike Anchorage, is many hundreds of miles from these Eskimos. It would\ntake months for them to make the journey in winter by dog team, and it\nwould be practically impossible to make it in the summer season by any\nmeans of travel except by aeroplane, which clearly these people could\nnot afford. Their dilemma is, accordingly, most tragic when they\nsuddenly become victims of diseases which require hospitalization or\nskilled medical or dental service. One mining engineer in the interior\ntold me that he had spent two thousand dollars to have a dentist\nbrought in by aeroplane to render dental service. On my examination of\nhis mouth I found twenty-nine of his thirty-two teeth had been attacked\nby dental caries.One important phase of modern degeneration, namely, change in\nfacial and dental arch form and other physical expressions, is of\ninterest. It is a matter of great significance that the Eskimos who are\nliving in isolated districts and on native foods have produced\nuniformly broad dental arches and typical Eskimo facial patterns. Even\nthe first generation forsaking that diet and using the modern diet,\npresents large numbers of individuals with marked changes in facial and\ndental arch form. In Fig. 12 will be seen four Eskimo girls who are of\nthe first generation following the adoption of modernized foods by\ntheir parents. All have deformed dental arches. It is important to note\nthe pattern of the settling inward of the lateral incisors and the\ncrowding outward of the cuspids. This facial design is currently\nassigned to a mixing of racial bloods. These girls are pure-blooded\nEskimos whose parents have normally formed dental arches.FIG. 12. While dental arch\ndeformities or crowded teeth are practically unknown among many of the\nprimitive groups of Eskimos, they occur frequently in the first\ngeneration of children born after the parents have adopted the white\nman's foods. Note the narrow nostrils and changed facial form of these\nchildren. This is not due to thumb sucking.We are particularly concerned with the foods used by these\nprimitive Eskimos. They almost always have their homes on or near deep\nwater. Their skill in handling their kayaks is most remarkable. During\nthe salmon running season they store large quantities of dried salmon.\nThey spear many of these fish from their kayaks; even young boys are\nvery skillful. They land salmon so large that they can hardly lift\nthem. They are expert in spearing seals from these light crafts. Seal\noil provides a very important part of their nutrition. As each piece of\nfish is broken off, it is dipped in seal oil. I obtained some seal oil\nfrom them and brought it to my laboratory for analyzing for its vitamin\ncontent. It proved to be one of the richest foods in vitamin A that I\nhave found.The fish are hung on racks in the wind for drying. Fish eggs are\nalso spread out to dry, as shown in Fig. 13. These foods constitute a\nvery important part of the nutrition of the small children after they\nare weaned. Naturally, the drifting sands of the bleak Bering Straits\nlodge upon and cling to the moist surfaces of the fish that are hung up\nto dry. This constitutes the principal cause for the excessive wear of\nthe Eskimos' teeth in both men and women.FIG. 13. The eggs of the salmon\nare dried and stored as an important item of nutrition for both\nchildren and adults. They are also used to increase the fertility of\nthe women. From a chemical standpoint they are one of the most\nnutritious foods I have found anywhere.The food of these Eskimos in their native state includes\ncaribou, ground nuts which are gathered by mice and stored in caches,\nkelp which is gathered in season and stored for winter use, berries\nincluding cranberries which are preserved by freezing, blossoms of\nflowers preserved in seal oil, sorrel grass preserved in seal oil, and\nquantities of frozen fish. Another important food factor consists of\nthe organs of the large animals of the sea, including certain layers of\nthe skin of one of the species of whale, which has been found to be\nvery high in vitamin C.Since contact with our modern civilization, the Eskimo\npopulation for Alaska is very rapidly declining. One authority has\nquoted the reduction of 50 per cent in population in seventy-five\nyears.An important observation has been made relative to the rapid\nshortening of the average life by Dr. V. E. Levine and Professor C. W.\nBauer, of Creighton University, Nebraska, who reported:Cordova, Alaska, Oct. 26, 1934--Due to\nsusceptibility to tuberculosis and other diseases the average life span\nof the Eskimo of Alaska is only 20 years and their race is doomed to\nextinction within a few generations unless modern medical science comes\nto their aid.Unless a very radical change is made in the interference with\nthe native supply of game and sea foods, the Eskimo population seems\ndestined to have a rapid decline and an early extinction. Their\nprimitive fish foods have been largely curtailed by the encroachment on\ntheir salmon streams made by modern canneries.It is of interest to discuss in connection with the Alaskan\nEskimo two white boys (one is shown in Fig. 14), who were sons of a\nmining engineer. They had been born and raised in a mining camp in\nAlaska, where their foods had been almost entirely shipped in. I\ntravelled with the mother of these two boys who was bringing them to\nthe United States for operations on their noses, because they were\nmouth-breathers. It is important to observe the marked underdevelopment\nof both the middle third and lower third of the face of the boy shown\nin Fig. 14. The nutrition of the family during their development and\ngrowth had been largely provided in package form shipped in from the\nUnited States. Their disfiguration is typical of that of large numbers\nthat are developing in our highly modernized communities, and is\nsimilar, in general, to the deformities which develop in the primitive\nraces after they adopt the modernized nutrition.FIG. 14. This white boy was\nborn and raised in Alaska on imported foods. His facial deformity\nincludes a lack of development of the air passages, so that he breathes\nthrough his mouth. Lack of bone development creates the crowded\ncondition of the teeth. Note his narrow nostrils.Notwithstanding the very inhospitable part of the world in which\nthey reside, with nine or ten months of winter and only two or three of\nsummer, and in spite of the absence for long periods of plant foods and\ndairy products and eggs, the Eskimos were able to provide their bodies\nwith all the mineral and vitamin requirements from sea foods, stored\ngreens and berries and plants from the sea.TABLE OF CONTENTSChapter 6PRIMITIVE AND MODERNIZED NORTH\nAMERICAN INDIANSNATURE seems to have made one of her large\nscale demonstrations in the Americas of the power of adaptation of a\nsingle racial stock to the scale of climates ranging from torrid\njungles of the tropics to the Arctics. The various members of the\nAmerican Indian race seem clearly to have come from a common origin.\nThe route by which they reached America from Asia as suggested by\nanthropologists was by way of the Bering Strait. Within a decade a\nRussian engineer has crossed from Asia to America on the pack ice of\nthe Bering sea, a distance of ninety miles. If this is possible now,\nhow much more likely is it that it has been possible in earlier periods\nof the world's history, as, for example, during or following the last\nice age, or at the time of an earlier ice age. The American Indian,\ntherefore, provides a very remarkable opportunity to study both the\ncapacity for adaptability to different environments and the variations\nthat different environments can produce in a single racial stock. That\nthe Indian of today is not in general a counterpart of the native\nresident at the time of the discovery of America by Columbus is clearly\ndemonstrated both by the skeletal material and by the early\nrecords.Our problem involved the location and study of groups of the\noriginal stock, if such were to be found, who were living in accordance\nwith the tradition of their race and as little affected as might be\npossible by the influence of the white man. At first thought it might\nseem impossible that such groups can exist, but as a matter of fact\nthere are still great areas of the American continent inhabited by the\noriginal stock living in areas still unexplored. In order to find\nIndians as little changed as possible by reason of their contact with\nthe white man, particularly with the white man's foods, I went to\nnorthern Canada to the region inside the Rocky Mountain range to study\nthe Indians of Northern British Columbia and the Yukon territory. Since\nan aeroplane could not be used, owing to the lack of a base of supplies\nfor fuel for the return trip; and since the MacKenzie water route was\nimpracticable (an expedition could not go up the waterways through\nCanada on the MacKenzie River and its branches and return the same\nseason), the route selected was that which enters that territory from\nAlaska on the large waterway of the Stikine River. This river has cut\nits channel through the Coast and Cascade Ranges of mountains and has\nits origin in the high western watershed of the Rockies. It was\nparticularly desirable to reach a group of Indians who could not obtain\nthe animal life of the sea, not even the running salmon. These fish do\nnot enter the waterways draining to the Arctic. We used a high-powered\nriver transport specially designed for going up rapids on the Stikine\nRiver to the end of navigation at Telegraph Creek. At this point large\nquantities of modern foods are stored during the short open navigation\nseason of the summer to be exchanged for furs during the long winter. A\nHudson Bay Post has been established at this point. Here a truck was\nchartered which took us over a trail across the Rocky Mountain Divide\nto the headwaters of the rivers flowing north to the Arctic. At this\noutpost two guides were engaged and a high powered scow chartered to\nmake the trip down the waterways toward the Arctic on the Diese and\nLiard Rivers. This made it possible, in the summer of 1933, to make\ncontact with large bands of Indians who had come out of the Pelly\nmountain country to exchange their catch of furs at the last outpost of\nthe Hudson Bay Company. Most of the Indians of Canada are under treaty\nwith the Canadian Government whereby that government gives them an\nannual per capita bounty. This arrangement induces the Indians in the\ninterior to come out to the designated centers to obtain the bounty.\nSince it is based on the number in the family, all of the children are\nbrought. This treaty, however, was never signed by the Indians of the\nBritish Columbia and Yukon Territory. And, accordingly, they have\nremained as nomadic wandering tribes following the moose and caribou\nherds in the necessary search to obtain their foods.The rigorous winters reach seventy degrees below zero. This\nprecludes the possibility of maintaining dairy animals or growing seed\ncereals or fruits. The diet of these Indians is almost entirely limited\nto the wild animals of the chase. This made a study of them exceedingly\nimportant. The wisdom of these people regarding Nature's laws, and\ntheir skill in adapting themselves to the rigorous climate and very\nlimited variety of foods, and these often very hard to obtain, have\ndeveloped a skill in the art of living comfortably with rugged Nature\nthat has been approached by few other tribes in the world. The sense of\nhonor among these tribes is so strong that practically all cabins,\ntemporarily unoccupied due to the absence of the Indians on their\nhunting trip, were entirely unprotected by locks; and the valuables\nbelonging to the Indians were left in plain sight. The people were\nremarkably hospitable, and where they had not been taken advantage of\nwere very kind. Many of the women had never seen a white woman until\nthey saw Mrs. Price. Their knowledge of woodcraft as expressed in skill\nin building their cabins so that they would be kept comfortably warm\nand protected from the sub-zero weather was remarkable. Their planning\nahead for storing provisions and firewood strongly emphasized their\ncommunity spirit. When an Indian and his family moved to a camp site on\na lake or river, they always girdled a few more trees than they would\nuse for firewood so that there would be a plentiful supply of dry\nstanding timber for future visitors to the camp.They lived in a country in which grizzly bears were common.\nTheir pelts were highly prized and they captured many of them with\nbaited pitfalls. Their knowledge of the use of different organs and\ntissues of the animals for providing a defense against certain of the\naffections of the body which we speak of as degenerative diseases was\nsurprising. When I asked an old Indian, through an interpreter, why the\nIndians did not get scurvy he replied promptly that that was a white\nman's disease. I asked whether it was possible for the Indians to get\nscurvy. He replied that it was, but said that the Indians know how to\nprevent it and the white man does not. When asked why he did not tell\nthe white man how, his reply was that the white man knew too much to\nask the Indian anything. I then asked him if he would tell me. He said\nhe would if the chief said he might. He went to see the chief and\nreturned in about an hour, saying that the chief said he could tell me\nbecause I was a friend of the Indians and had come to tell the Indians\nnot to eat the food in the white man's store. He took me by the hand\nand led me to a log where we both sat down. He then described how when\nthe Indian kills a moose he opens it up and at the back of the moose\njust above the kidney there are what he described as two small balls in\nthe fat. These he said the Indian would take and cut up into as many\npieces as there were little and big Indians in the family and each one\nwould eat his piece. They would eat also the walls of the second\nstomach. By eating these parts of the animal the Indians would keep\nfree from scurvy, which is due to the lack of vitamin C. The Indians\nwere getting vitamin C from the adrenal glands and organs. Modern\nscience has very recently discovered that the adrenal glands are the\nrichest sources of vitamin C in all animal or plant tissues. We found\nthese Indians most cooperative in aiding us. We, of course, had taken\npresents that we thought would be appreciated by them, and we had no\ndifficulty in making measurements and photographs, nor, indeed, in\nmaking a detailed study of the condition of each tooth in the dental\narches. I obtained samples of saliva, and of their foods for chemical\nanalysis. A typical Indian family in the big timber forests in shown in\nFig. 15.FIG. 15. This typical family of\nforest Indians of Northern Canada presents a picture of superb health.\nThey live amidst an abundance of food in the form of wild animal life\nin the shelter of the big timber.The condition of the teeth, and the shape of the dental arches\nand the facial form, were superb. Indeed, in several groups examined\nnot a single tooth was found that had ever been attacked by tooth\ndecay. In an examination of eighty-seven individuals having 2,464 teeth\nonly four teeth were found that had ever been attacked by dental\ncaries. This is equivalent to 0.16 per cent. As we came back to\ncivilization and studied, successively, different groups with\nincreasing amounts of contact with modern civilization, we found dental\ncaries increased progressively, reaching 25.5 per cent of all of the\nteeth examined at Telegraph Creek, the point of contact with the white\nman's foods. As we came down the Stikine River to the Alaskan frontier\ntowns, the dental caries problem increased to 40 per cent of all of the\nteeth.Careful inquiry regarding the presence of arthritis was made in\nthe more isolated groups. We neither saw nor heard of a case in the\nisolated groups. However, at the point of contact with the foods of\nmodern civilization many cases were found including ten bed-ridden\ncripples in a series of about twenty Indian homes. Some other\naffections made their appearance here, particularly tuberculosis which\nwas taking a very severe toll of the children who had been born at this\ncenter. In Fig. 16 are seen two typical cases of tubercular involvement\nof glands of the neck. The suffering from tooth decay was tragic. There\nwere no dentists, no doctors available within hundreds of miles to\nrelieve suffering.FIG. 16. At the point of\nmodernization including the use of the foods of modern commerce, the\nhealth problem of the Indians is very different. These modernized\nIndian children are dying of tuberculosis which seldom kills the\nprimitives.The physiques of the Indians of the far north who are still\nliving in their isolated locations and in accordance with their\naccumulated wisdom were superb. There were practically no irregular\nteeth, including no impacted third molars, as evidenced by the fact\nthat all individuals old enough to have the molars erupted had them\nstanding in position and functioning normally for mastication. The\nexcellence of the dental arches is shown in Fig. 17. Where the Indians\nwere using the white man's food tooth decay was very severe, as shown\nin Fig. 18. In the new generation, after meeting the white civilization\nand using his foods, many developed crooked teeth, so-called, with\ndeformed dental arches, as seen in Fig. 19.FIG. 17. Wherever the Indians\nwere living on their native foods, chiefly moose and caribou meat,\ntheir physical development including facial and dental arch form was\nsuperb with nearly complete immunity to dental caries. These two women\nand two girls are typical.FIG. 18. Wherever the Indians\nhad access to the modern foods of commerce the dental conditions were\nextremely bad. These four individuals are typical.FIG. 19. The blight of the\nwhite man's commerce is seen everywhere in the distorted countenances\nof even the first generation after the adoption by the parents of the\nfoods of modern commerce. These young people with their deformed dental\narches are typical. Note the faulty development of the facial bones as\nevidenced by the narrow nostrils and crowded teeth.Contact was also made with representatives of relatively\nisolated primitive Indian stocks in the district south of Hudson Bay.\nThese groups were reached by a newly projected railroad extending\neastward and northward from Winnipeg, Manitoba, and we were thus\nbrought into contact with the Indians that had come out of the\nwaterways draining the Hudson Bay and from as far north as James Bay.\nThey had come down to dispose of their furs in exchange for ammunition,\nblankets, etc. Since this contact was made only once or twice a year,\nit was quite impossible for the Indians to carry back a sufficient\nquantity of the foods of the white man to have great influence on their\ntotal diet for the year. They still lived on the wild animal game of\nthe land. As in the northern country just reviewed, their principal\nlarge animal was the moose. These are treaty Indians, and many of them\ncome out to this frontier to obtain the government bounty and,\naccordingly, were obliged to bring their families. The bounty here\namounted to five dollars per head, a considerable income in exchange\nfor blankets and other equipment. Some of these contact points were at\nthe height of the land dividing the waters running north and east to\nJames Bay and Hudson Bay, or south to Lake Superior. This was historic\ncountry that had been the meeting ground of the tribes of the northern\nwaters with the tribes of the Great Lakes district. Many battles had\nbeen fought there. For comparison with these more primitive groups from\nthe Hudson and James Bay watershed, I had the opportunity here of\nstudying families that had taken up residence along the railroad or in\nits vicinity in order that they might have the advantage of exchanging\nfurs for the modern white man's foods. This gave us an excellent\nopportunity to study the effects of the modern dietary, of which an\nexample is shown in Fig. 20. This Indian and his wife had built their\nbodies before the contact with the white man. He is about six feet\ntall. Both the parents had splendid dental arches and well formed\nfaces. His teeth are shown in Fig. 20 (upper, left). Their two children\nshown in the photograph were born after the adoption of the white man's\nfoods brought in by the railroad. Both are mouth-breathers and both\nhave narrow dental arches and marked underdevelopment of the middle\nthird of the face. The older girl has tuberculosis. Another adult man\nis shown in Fig. 20 (upper, right). He, like the generation he\nrepresents, has exceptionally fine dental arches and well developed\nface.FIG. 20. These primitive\nIndians are in central Canada. The three parents were developed before\ntheir district was reached by modern civilization. Note their good\nphysical and facial form in contrast with the pinched nostrils of the\ntwo children. The oldest girl has tuberculosis. They are the product of\ncivilization's contact with their primitive parents.At this point we again found many of the younger generation ill\nwith tuberculosis or crippled with arthritis. Two of these are shown in\nFig. 21.FIG. 21. These are typical\ncripples met at the point of contact of our modern civilization with\nthe primitive Indians. The boy at the left has arthritis in nearly all\nof his joints. He has several abscessed teeth. The boy at the right has\ntubercul sis of the spine.For further comparison of the more isolated and more highly\nmodernized groups a study was made of the Indians in the largest single\nIndian Reservation in Canada, which is located at Brantford, Ontario.\nIn this group there are about 4,700 Indians living under highly\nmodernized conditions provided by the Canadian Government. They live on\nvery fertile land and in close proximity to a modern Canadian city.\nEach head of a family is provided with a tract of land from which he\nusually has an income sufficient to permit him to have an automobile.\nThey were able to buy not only necessities and comforts according to\nthe modern standards of the white man, but many of the luxuries as\nwell. The government provides a well administered hospital and staff.\nWhen I asked the Director of this hospital, Dr. Davis, what the\nprincipal use of the hospital was at that time (1933), he said that the\ndemand for beds had completely changed in the twenty-eight years he had\nbeen there. The principal services requested at the hospital in 1933\nrelated to the problems of maternity. He stated that in his period of\ncontact he had seen three generations of mothers. The grandmothers of\nthe present generation would take a shawl and either alone or\naccompanied by one member of their family retire to the bush and give\nbirth to the baby and return with it to the cabin. A problem of little\ndifficulty or concern, it seemed. He stated that today the young\nmothers of this last generation are brought to his hospital sometimes\nafter they have been in labor for days. They are entirely different\nfrom their grandmothers or even mothers in their capacity and\nefficiency in the matter of reproduction. He stated that that morning\nhe had had two cases in which surgical interference was necessary in\norder to make birth possible.We had an opportunity here to study the effects of\nmodernization. Indians are great lovers of sports, particularly of\ntheir own national game which is lacrosse. We were able to witness one\nof these contests with a team from another reservation. Indian families\ncame in modern automobiles dressed in modern clothes and purchased pop\nand candy and modern confections at typical confection stands. These\nwere highly modernized Indians.The group on this reservation, comprising approximately four\nthousand seven hundred Indians, belong to the following tribes:\nMohawks, Onondagas, Cayugas, Senecas, Oneidas and Delawares making up\nthe Six Nation or Iroquois group. A later addition to this group has\nbeen the Tuscaroras from the Carolinas. While there were many mixed\nbloods, there were also a goodly number of full-blooded Indian\nfamilies, so that there was an opportunity to study comparatively the\neffects of intermingling of the Indians with the whites. As in previous\ninvestigations, a special effort was made to study the children from\neight to sixteen years of age. Typical cases were selected from\ndifferent environments. For example, boys and girls selected from a\ntraining school called Mohawk Institute, which was near the city of\nBrantford, represented one type of environment. There are approximately\none hundred and sixty students under training here, and we were\ninformed that they study half a day and work half a day. The boys are\ntaught craftsmanship and farming, the girls, home economics and garment\nmaking, and such practical training as would prepare them for later\nhome building. While most of the boys and girls come from that\nreservation, a few are accepted from other reservations. It is of\ninterest that 77 per cent of the children in this Institution had\nsuffered from earlier dental caries and that 17 per cent of all the\nteeth examined had already been attacked by dental caries. But this had\noccurred apparently before their entrance to the Institute, for we did\nnot find a single case of active caries among those examined, and this\nis particularly important in connection with their excellent nutrition.\nThe Institute maintained a fine dairy herd and provided fresh\nvegetables, whole wheat bread, and limited the sugar and white\nflour.The children of this group were compared with children of\napproximately the same age in a public school of the reservation where\nit was found that 90 per cent had had dental caries, and that at\npresent in 70 per cent of the cases the caries was apparently active.\nIt is important to note that in this group 28.5 per cent of all the\nteeth examined had already been attacked by tooth decay.A study was made of patients at the reservation hospital where\nfree service of all kinds is provided. We found that 83 per cent had\nsuffered from dental caries, and that 23.2 per cent of all teeth had\nalready been attacked by caries.We were particularly interested in the conditions obtaining in\nthe homes, especially with the mothers. A typical young mother had\napproximately half her teeth attacked by dental caries, as had also her\nson, aged seven. The middle third of his face was underdeveloped and\nall of his upper anterior teeth were decayed to the gum line.A study was made of an Indian reservation in New York State for\ncomparison and for making an estimate of typical modern American Indian\nlife with regard to dental caries and nutrition. For this study a band\nof 450 in the Tuscarora Reservation northeast of Niagara Falls was\nvisited. Here again we were fortunate to see the people in holiday mood\nsince the study was made on Decoration Day and events of the year had\nbeen scheduled, a lacrosse match and a baseball game, between the\nIndians' teams and white teams from adjacent towns. Several hundred\nIndians were congregated to exhibit their best in wearing apparel,\ntransportation equipment, and physical prowess. There was evidence of a\nsimilarity of features in the older Indians who had not been highly\nmodernized, and a striking deficiency in the facial development of many\nof the moderns.A typical mother was studied at her home. She had four children.\nHer teeth were ravaged by dental caries. She was strictly modern, for\nshe had gold inlays in some of her teeth. The roots of the missing\nteeth had not been extracted. Twenty of her teeth had active dental\ncaries. Her little girl, aged four, already had twelve very badly\ncarious teeth. Another daughter aged eight had sixteen carious teeth,\nand her son aged ten had six. The husband was in bed from an acute lung\ninvolvement, doubtless tuberculosis. The children were eating their\nnoon day meal when we arrived, which consisted of a white bread and\nsome stewed vegetables. Milk was available for only the small baby in\narms. In this Tuscarora group 83 per cent of those examined had dental\ncaries and 38 per cent of all teeth had already been attacked by dental\ncaries. Every one studied in this reservation was using white-flour\nproducts, none were using milk liberally, and only a few in even\nlimited amounts. I was told that in both reservations a few years ago\nthe Indians grew wheat and kept cows to provide a liberal supply of\nnatural cereal and milk for their families, but of late this practice\nhad been discontinued. They were now buying their wheat in the form of\nwhite flour and their vegetables largely put up in cans. In both\nreservations they were using commercial vegetable fats, jams and\nmarmalades, sweetened goods, syrups and confections very liberally. It\nis remarkable how early the child life adopts modern civilization's\nconfections.In order to provide a further cross section of the modernized\nIndians of North America, I made a study in a reservation on Winnipeg\nLake in Manitoba. This reservation lies north and east of Winnipeg and\nis quite highly modernized.These people were reached with much difficulty because of the\nnatural protection provided by the location of their reservation at the\nmouth of Brokenhead River. They had been provided with fertile lands\nand taught modern methods of farming. Their proximity to a great body\nof water fairly well-stocked with fish gave them an opportunity to\nsecure fish, if they were disposed to make the effort to do so, as\ntheir ancestors had done through previous centuries. Their homes were\nfound to be in a dilapidated condition, and while their lands were\nstocked with cattle and horses, such as we found were in poor\ncondition, and limited in number. The people had been provided with a\ngovernment school and a government agent to assist in providing for\ntheir needs and in giving material assistance when needed. They were\nwithin fairly easy distance of hospitals, and had available modern\nmedical service. Notwithstanding all these advantages, their physical\ncondition was very poor. Dental caries was so wide-spread that 39.1 per\ncent of all teeth studied were found to be affected. They were living\nalmost entirely on modern foods, imported white flours, jams, canned\nvegetables and liberal quantities of sugar. Over 90 per cent of the\nindividuals had rampant dental caries. Their physical condition and\ntheir supply of necessities was very much lower than was that of either\nof the two preceding groups. Distress was evident even in late\nsummer.The Indians so far reported were living inland with access to\ninland foods only. The Pacific Coast Indians were examined to determine\nthe effect of sea foods. To find evidence relating to the physical, and\nparticularly to the dental condition of the Indians who inhabited the\nPacific slope a thousand or more years ago, a visit was made to the\nVancouver Museum at Vancouver which fortunately possesses splendidly\npreserved specimens of prehistoric periods. Some of these skulls were\nuncovered while cutting through a hill for a street extension in the\ncity of Vancouver. Above was a virgin forest of large size green firs\nand underneath them in the soil there were preserved fallen trunks of\nother large trees. Several feet below these, burials were uncovered\ncontaining skeletons of an early Indian race. This collection contains\nalso skulls from several places and from prehistoric periods. The teeth\nare all splendidly formed and free from dental caries. The arches are\nvery symmetrical and the teeth in normal and regular position.It was important to study the conditions of their successors\nliving in the same general community. Accordingly, we examined the\nteeth and general physical condition of the Indians in a reservation in\nNorth Vancouver, so situated that they have the modern conveniences and\nmodern foods. In this group of children between eight and fifteen years\nof age, 36.9 per cent of all the teeth examined had already been\nattacked by dental caries. No people were found in this group who were\nliving largely on native foods.Vancouver Island with its salubrious climate is one of the most\nfavored places of residence on the Pacific Coast. It was of particular\ninterest to study the Indians near Victoria on this island in the\nCraigflower Indian Reservation. Indeed, the city of Victoria has been\npartly built on the original Craigflower Indian Reservation. As the\nneed became acute for the territory reserved for them, an arrangement\nwas consummated whereby the Indians were induced to exchange that land\nfor new land in an adjoining district in which a new house was built\nfree for each family. Besides a house, an allotment of land and a sum\nof money, reported to be ten thousand dollars, was given to each\nfamily. This allowed them to become very modern, and, accordingly, many\nof them owned automobiles and other modern luxuries. The physical\neffects of the use of food luxuries, resulting from ample funds for\npurchasing any foods that they might desire, was marked. They were in\nclose proximity to skilled dental service and had practical training in\noral prophylaxis. Notwithstanding this, 48.5 per cent of all teeth\nexamined had already been attacked by dental caries. Every individual\nexamined was suffering from tooth decay. The original diet of the\nIndians of the Pacific Coast was, as we shall see, very largely sea\nfoods, which are probably as abundant today as ever before. It would\nrequire a real urge to go to catch the fish since they can now be\npurchased canned in the open market. Like most modern people, they were\nliving on white-flour products, sweet foods and pastries.Probably few cities of the Pacific Coast have had a greater\nabundance and variety of edible sea foods, particularly the various\nkinds of salmon, than Ketchikan. It is beautifully located on an\nisland, and is the most southerly city in Alaska. Among the many fish\nthat are abundant along this part of the Pacific Coast is the oolachan\nor candle fish. It is a small fish, but very rich in oil; so much so\nthat it gets its name from being burned as a candle for light. This oil\nis collected in large quantities and used as a dressing for many of\ntheir sea foods. It is also traded with the Indians of the interior for\nfurs and other products. An Indian settlement in this city was studied\nand it was found that 46.6 per cent of all teeth examined had already\nbeen attacked by tooth decay. In many of the homes individuals were ill\nwith tuberculosis or arthritis. Tuberculosis had robbed many of the\nhomes of one or more of its children.At Juneau, the capital of Alaska, two groups were studied; one\nin the government hospital, and the other in an Indian settlement. In\nthe hospital were both Indians and Eskimos, chiefly the former.\nSeventy-five per cent of the patients were reported to have been\nbrought because they had tuberculosis, and some who had come because of\naccident and other conditions were reported to have tuberculosis also.\nApproximately 50 per cent of the total hospital enrollment was under 21\nyears of age. The dental conditions were bad, for 39.1 per cent of all\nthe teeth examined had been attacked by tooth decay.In the Indian settlement, a group of elderly primitives was\nfound, every one of whom had complete dentitions in normal arrangement\nof the arches and without dental caries. In a settlement of modern\nIndians living principally on modern foods 40 per cent of all teeth had\nbeen attacked by tooth decay.At Sitka, the former capital, two important groups were studied.\nLocated here is the Sheldon Jackson School for Eskimos and Indian boys\nand girls, chiefly Indians. They have come from widely scatterd\nterritory throughout Alaska, and represent the finest physical\nspecimens that can readily be secured for giving the advantages of an\neducation. Of necessity they came very largely from the modernized\ndistricts. In this group 53.7 per cent of all the teeth examined had\nalready been attacked by tooth decay. This gives an indication of the\ndental conditions in the large number of modernized districts which\nthey represented.In a settlement at Sitka, a group of Indians of various ages\nwere studied, and it was found that 35.6 per cent of all their teeth\nhad already been attacked by dental caries. A well preserved native\nIndian, seventy years of age, was found who had come into town from\nanother district. He stated that his diet had consisted chiefly of\nfish, fish eggs, seaweed and deer. His teeth were of very high\nexcellence and were entirely free from past or present dental caries.\nHe is a splendid example of the product of the native dietary provided\nfor the Pacific Coast people of any period or stage of\ncivilization.The local physician at Sitka kindly gave very valuable\ninformation relative to the attitude of the native Indians in the\nmatter of obtaining fresh sea foods when foods that were very\nsatisfying could be so easily obtained in concentrated form at the\nvarious stores. They could go to one of the piers at almost any time of\nthe year and catch fish or secure them as they had been accustomed to\ndo before the arrival of modern foods, but there is a constant striving\nto be like and live like the white people. They seem to think it is a\nmark of distinction to purchase their foods and that it is degrading to\nhave to forage for one's foods. They very readily come to depend on\nwhite flour and sugar, jams and canned vegetables; and much prefer to\nhave the government or charitable organization supply these when they\ncannot purchase them, rather than go out and secure their own\nnutrition. This physician stated that there were about 800 whites\nliving in the town and about 400 Indians, and that notwithstanding this\ndifference in numbers there were twice as many Indian children born as\nwhite children, but that by the time these children reached six years\nof age there were more white children living than Indian and half-breed\nchildren. This he stated was largely due to the very high child\nmortality rate, of which the most frequent cause is tuberculosis. While\nit does not take many decades to record a distinct physical\ndeterioration, a deteriorating parenthood greatly speeds up this\nprocess. While physical defects acquired by the parent will not be\ntransmitted as such, prenatal deficiencies may be established because\nof the physical defects of the mother resulting from her faulty\nnutrition, and these deficiencies, together with disturbed nutrition of\ninfancy and early childhood will go far in determining whether there\nwill be for the child a physical breakdown or whether the normal\ndefense of the body will be adequate to protect it from various\ninfections to which it may later be exposed.Sitka has furnished the longest history of contact with white\nmen of almost any community on the Pacific Coast. Indeed, it was a\nfamous seaport long before any United States Pacific Coast communities\nhad been established. It is of much interest that it was a shipbuilding\ncenter for vessels in the Russian trade. Its foundries were developed\nso efficiently that the bells of the early monasteries of California\nwere cast in this town by the Russians. It contains some of the best\nexamples of the early Russian architecture, particularly in its\ncathedral.Anchorage is the principal city of western Alaska, since it is\nnot only a base for the railroad running north to Fairbanks, but a base\nfor aeroplane companies operating throughout various parts of Alaska.\nIt is accordingly a combination of a coast city with its retail\nactivities and a wholesale base for outfitters for the interior. It has\nan excellent government hospital which probably has been built around\nthe life of one man whom many people told us was the most beloved man\nin all Alaska. He is Dr. Josef Romig, a surgeon of great skill and with\nan experience among the Eskimos and Indians, both the primitives and\nmodernized, extending over thirty-six years. I am deeply indebted to\nhim for much information and for assistance in making contacts. He took\nme, for example, to several typically modernized Indian homes in the\ncity. In one, the grandmother, who had come from the northern shore of\nCook Inlet to visit her daughter, was sixty-three years of age, and was\nentirely free from tooth decay and had lost only one of her teeth. Her\nson, who had accompanied her, was twenty-four years of age. He had only\none tooth that had ever been attacked by tooth decay. Their diet had\nbeen principally moose and deer meat, fresh and dried fish, a few\nvegetables and at time some cranberries. Recently the son had been\nobtaining some modern foods. Her daughter, twenty-nine years of age,\nhad married a white man and had had eight children. She and they were\nliving on modern foods entirely. Twenty-one of her thirty-two teeth had\nbeen wrecked by dental caries. Their diet consisted largely of white\nbread, syrup and potatoes. Her children whom we examined ranged from\nfive to twelve years of age, and in that family 37 per cent of all the\nteeth have already been attacked by dental caries, notwithstanding the\nyoung age of the children. The mother of this family is shown in Fig.\n18 (upper, left). It is of great importance that not only was dental\ncaries rampant, but that there were marked deformity of the dental\narches and irregularity of teeth in the cases of the children.Among the many items of information of great interest furnished\nby Dr. Romig were facts that fitted well into the modern picture of\nassociation of modern degenerative processes with modernization. He\nstated that in his thirty-six years of contact with these people he had\nnever seen a case of malignant disease among the truly primitive\nEskimos and Indians, although it frequently occurs when they become\nmodernized. He found similarly that the acute surgical problems\nrequiring operation on internal organs such as the gall bladder,\nkidney, stomach, and appendix do not tend to occur among the primitive,\nbut are very common problems among the modernized Eskimos and Indians.\nGrowing out of his experience, in which he had seen large numbers of\nthe modernized Eskimos and Indians attacked with tuberculosis, which\ntended to be progressive and ultimately fatal as long as the patients\nstayed under modernized living conditions, he now sends them back when\npossible to primitive conditions and to a primitive diet, under which\nthe death rate is very much lower than under modernized conditions.\nIndeed, he reported that a great majority of the afflicted recover\nunder the primitive type of living and nutrition.The institutions that have been organized for the care of\norphans and for the education of Eskimo and Indian boys and girls\nprovide an opportunity to study conditions. A particularly favorable\ninstitution is located at Eklutna on the railroad north of Anchorage.\nMany of the individuals in the school had come from districts so remote\nfrom transportation facilities that their isolation had compelled them\nto live mostly on native foods, at least during their early childhood.\nThey had come from districts very widely distributed throughout the\nAlaskan peninsula. Credit is due to the management of this institution\nfor preparing and storing dried salmon for use throughout the winter.\nThe beneficial effects of their good nutritional program were evident.\nThe percentage of teeth attacked by dental caries was 14.6. A large\npercentage of these pupils were of mixed blood of native Eskimos or\nIndians with whites. The white parent had probably been largely\nresponsible for their attendance at this training school. There were\nseveral full-blooded Eskimos and Indians from modernized communities\nwhere they had been living on modern foods throughout their entire\nlifetime. This gave an opportunity to study the rôle of\nnutritional deficiencies in the development of deformities and\nirregularities in the facial features, in the arrangement of the teeth,\nand in the inter-relationship between the dental arches. The typical\nirregularities and divergencies from normal were present in the\nfull-blooded Eskimo and Indian boys and girls in as high percentage as\nin the mixed bloods. Some of the young people with parentage of mixed\nblood have beautiful features.Another important institutional group was studied at Seward in\nthe Jesse Lee Home which had first been established at Nome and had\nbeen moved to Seward to avoid the extreme isolation of that district.\nThis institution is located at Resurrection Bay which is one of the\nmost beautiful harbors in the world. It gives shelter and educational\nopportunities to Eskimos and Indians, chiefly of mixed blood, from a\nlarge area of Alaska, and particularly from the Aleutian Peninsula, the\nAleutian Islands and the Bering Sea. These individuals, whether of\nmixed or pure blood, had come chiefly from homes that were in large\npart modernized. The incidence of dental caries found here was 27.5 per\ncent for all teeth examined. Here again all individuals were affected.\nNotwithstanding the unusually fine hygienic conditions and highly\ntrained dietitians of this institution, a medical ward and trained\nnurses, tuberculosis was reaping a heavy toll. I was told that 60 per\ncent of all those students who had moved with the school from Nome to\nthis location were already dead from tuberculosis. It is common\nknowledge that tuberculosis has played a very important rôle in\ndecimating the Indian and Eskimo population in the Pacific Coast towns\nand villages. A very important phase of these investigations is the\ndevelopment of new light on the rôle of nutrition in lowering the\ndefense of these individuals so that with their low inheritance of\ndefensive factors they rapidly become susceptible to tuberculosis.The problem of evaluating the influence of a particular\nenvironment on racial and tribal development is relatively simple when\nstudying contemporary remnants of primitive racial stocks. However,\ngroups that have lived and disappeared in the past do not permit of so\nsimple a procedure for making physical estimates. Fortunately, we have\nin the burial grounds not only the skeletons, but also many of the\nimplements used in daily life. Sometimes these contain samples of the\nfoods. We may find also their art ware and hunting equipment. While the\nperiod may not be definitely recorded, the knowledge of the history of\nthe pottery of the tribe often gives an important clue to the dates as\nwill also the method of burial. Burials made before the advent of the\nChristian era will in many groups show the bodies in a flexed position\nwith the arms in the lap, whereas in the Christian burials the bodies\nhave been laid prone and the arms crossed on the chest. By this sign\nthe pre-Columbian burials can readily be separated from the\npost-Columbian.Using these guides, a study of the Indians of Florida, past and\npresent, permits of comparing the pre-Columbians with those living\ntoday in that same territory. We will, accordingly, consider the dental\ncaries problem and that of facial and dental arch form in the Florida\nIndians by comparing three groups: namely, the pre-Columbian, as\nevidenced from a study of the skull material in the museums; the tribes\nof Indians living in as much isolation as is possible in the Everglades\nand Cypress Swamps; and the Indians of the same stock that are living\nin contact with the foods of modern civilization. This latter group\nlives along the Tamiami trail and near Miami. In a study of several\nhundred skulls taken from the burial mounds of southern Florida, the\nincidence of tooth decay was so low as to constitute an immunity of\napparently one hundred per cent, since in several hundred skulls not a\nsingle tooth was found to have been attacked by tooth decay. Dental\narch deformity and the typical change in facial form due to an\ninadequate nutrition were also completely absent, all dental arches\nhaving a form and interdental relationship such as to bring them into\nthe classification of normal. These are illustrated in Figs. 22 and 23.\nThe problem of reaching the isolated groups living in the depth of the\nCypress Swamps was complicated by the fact that these people had a\ndread of all whites growing out of their belief that they had been\ngrossly taken advantage of in some of their early efforts to make a\ntreaty with the whites. With the assistance of three guides, one, an\nIndian of their own group, another, a white man whom they trusted, and\nthe third, a government nurse who had been very helpful in case of\nsickness, we were able to take the desired measurements and records and\nphotographs. A group of these more primitive representatives is shown\nin Fig. 24. While their hunting territory had been grossly encroached\nupon by the white hunters, they were still able to maintain a very high\ndegree of physical excellence and high immunity to dental caries. Only\nfour teeth in each hundred examined were found to have been attacked by\ntooth decay.FIG. 22. Skulls of primitive\nIndians showing superb dental arches typical of Nature's normal plan.\nNote the splendid position of the third molars which are so frequently\ndefective in position and quality in our modern white civilization. In\nmany districts where I have made studies among primitive Indians and in\nmany collections of their skulls close to a hundred per cent of the\nteeth have been free from dental caries or faulty\nposition.FIG. 23. The Indian skulls that\nhave been uncovered in many parts of the United States and Canada show\na degree of excellence comparable to those seen in this Figure. These\nlevels of excellence were the rule with them, not the exception as with\nus. The parents of these individuals knew what they and their children\nshould eat!FIG. 24. The Seminole Indians\nliving today in southern Florida largely beyond contact with the white\ncivilization still produce magnificent teeth and dental arches of which\nthese are typical. They live in the Everglade forest and still obtain\nthe native foods.Practically all of the dental arches were normal in contour with\nfreedom from facial distortion. In contrast with this, the Indians of\nFlorida who are living today in contact with modern civilization\npresent a pathetic picture. Forty out of every hundred teeth examined\nwere found to have been attacked by tooth decay, typically illustrated\nin Fig. 25. In the latest generation, many dental arches showed a\ntypical deformation with crowding of the teeth and narrowing of the\nface, conditions that have been found in all human stocks when on an\ninadequate nutrition during the formative and early growth period. A\ngroup of these is typically illustrated in Fig. 26.FIG. 25. The Seminole Indians\nof Florida who are living in contact with our modern civilization and\nits foods suffer from rampant dental caries.FIG. 26. Seminole Indians. Note\nthe change in facial and dental arch form in the children of this\nmodernized group. They have a marked lack of development of the facial\nbones with a narrowing of the nostrils and dental arches with crowding\nof the teeth. Their faces are stamped with the blight which so many\noften think of as normal because it is so common with\nus.It is of interest that the quality of the skeletal material that\nis taken from the mounds showed unusually fine physical development and\nfreedom from joint involvements. In contrast with this, many of the\nindividuals of the modernized group were suffering from advanced\ndeformities of the skeleton due to arthritic processes.The effects of the excellent nutrition of the pre-Columbian\nIndians is indicated in the comparative thickness of the skulls. In\nFig. 27 are shown two pieces of a pre-Columbian skull in contrast with\na modern skull. The specimen of a trephined lower jaw, shown in Fig. 27\n(right) indicates a knowledge of surgery that is very remarkable. The\nmargins show new bone growth. The operation opened a cyst.FIG. 27. Left: Example of\ngreater thickness of pre-Columbian Indian skulls in Florida than modern\nskulls. Right: Illustration of bone surgery of ancient Florida Indians.\nNote healing of margins of trephined opening into a cyst, of the lower\njaw. This is typical of the advanced surgery of the Peruvian\nIndians.For the study of a group of Indians now living in a high western\nstate, Albuquerque, New Mexico, was visited.Several other Indian studies have been made including studies of\nliving groups, recently opened burials and museum collections, all of\nwhich support the findings recorded here. I am indebted to the\ndirectors and to the staffs of these institutions for their\nassistance.Notwithstanding the wide range of physical and climatic\nconditions under which primitive Indians had been living, their\nincidence of tooth decay while on their native foods was always near\nzero; whereas, the modernized Indians of these groups showed very high\nincidence of dental caries. A summary of percentages follows:Primitive Indians:Pelly Mountain, 0.16 per cent; Juneau, 0.00\nper cent; Florida Pre-Columbian, 0.00 per cent; Florida Seminoles, 4.0\nper cent.Modernized Indians:Telegraph Creek, 25.5 per cent;\nAlaska Frontier, 40.0 per cent; Mohawk Institute, 17 per cent;\nBrantford Reservation Public School, 28.5 per cent; Brantford\nReservation Hospital, 23.2 per cent, Tuscarora Reservation, 38.0 per\ncent; Winnipeg Lake Reservation, 39.1 per cent; North Vancouver\nReservation, 36.9 per cent; Craigflower Indian Reservation, 48.5 per\ncent; Ketchikan, 46.6 per cent; Juneau Hospital, 39.1 per cent; Sheldon\nJackson School, 53.7 per cent; Sitka, 35.6 per cent; Eklutna, 14.6 per\ncent; Jessie Lee Home, Seward, 27.6 per cent, and Florida Seminoles,\n40.0 per cent.The foods used by the primitives varies according to location\nand climate. The foods of the modernized groups in all cases were the\ntypical white man's foods of commerce.While the primitive groups constantly presented well-formed\nfaces and dental arches reproducing the tribal pattern, the new\ngeneration, after the adoption of white man's foods, showed marked\nchanges in facial and dental arch form.The Indians like several primitive races I have studied are\naware of the fact that their degeneration is in some way brought about\nby their contact with the white man. The dislike of the American Indian\nfor the modern white civilization has been emphasized by many writers.\nIn my studies among the Seminole Indians of Florida I found great\ndifficulty in communicating with or making examination of the isolated\nSeminoles living deep in the Everglades and Cypress Swamp. Fortunately,\nI had the able assistance of one of their own tribe, a government nurse\nwho had been very helpful to them and also a white man who had\nbefriended them and whom they trusted. With their assistance I was able\nto carry out very detailed studies. It was of interest, however, that\nwhen we arrived at a settlement in the bush we practically always found\nit uninhabited. Our Indian guide would go into the surrounding scrub\nand call to the people assuring them it was to their advantage to come\nout, which they finally did. I was told that this attitude had grown\nout of the belief on their part that their treaties had been violated.\nThese isolated Seminole Indian women had the reputation of turning\ntheir backs on all white men.A United States Press report(1)provides\nan article with the heading\"Tribes 'Fed Up' Seek Solitude, Indians\nDislike Civilization, Ask Land Barred to White Men.\"The article\ncontinues:The Bureau of Indian Affairs revealed today that\nfive Indian tribes in Oklahoma are \"fed up\" with white civilization and\nwant new, secluded tribal lands.So widespread is the discontent among the\n100,000 Indians living in Oklahoma, officials said, that serious study\nis being given to the possibility of providing new lands where the\nredman may hunt and fish as his ancestors did.Dissatisfaction has been brewing for a long time\nas a result of an increasing Indian population, decreasing Indian lands\nand unsatisfactory economic conditions. It was brought officially to\nthe notice of bureau officials several days ago when a delegation,\nheaded by Jack Gouge, a Creek Indian from Hanna, Okla., told Indian\nCommissioner John Collier that most of the Oklahoma Indians wanted new\ntribal lands away from white civilization.So anxious are his people to escape from the\nwhite man and his influences, Jack Gouge said, that an organization of\nabout 1000 Indians has been formed to press the demands. It is known as\nthe \"Four Mothers,\" apparently representing four of the \"civilized\ntribes\"--the Creeks, Choctaws, Cherokees and Chickasaws.The fifth civilized tribe, the Seminoles of\nOklahoma, are negotiating with the Mexican government for tribal lands\nin that country.These tribes are described as \"civilized\"\nbecause of the high degree of culture they attained in their original\ntribal lands along the eastern coast. As their eastern lands became\nvaluable the Indians were moved to the area which is now Oklahoma. At\nthe turn of the century, however, with the discovery of oil there the\nnew tribal lands were broken up. The Indians were forcibly removed to\nsmall tracts despite their desire to remain together. Indian Bureau\nofficials do not conceal their bitterness over the white man's\n\"treachery.\" One official pointed out that about 300 treaties have been\nsigned with the Indians and that practically every one has been\nviolated.It will be most fortunate if in the interest of science and\nhuman betterment such a program as this will be carried out in order to\npermit these Indians to live in accordance with the accumulated wisdom\nof their various tribes. Their preservation in isolation would preserve\ntheir culture. The greatest heritage of the white man today is the\naccumulated wisdom of the human race.REFERENCETribes \"Fed Up\" Seek Solitude.Cleveland Press,June 19,\n1938.TABLE OF CONTENTSChapter 7ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED\nMELANESIANSSINCE our quest was to gather data that will\nthrow light upon the cause of modern physical degeneration among human\nracial stocks in various parts of the world, it became necessary to\ninclude for study various groups living in the hot sultry climates of\nthe tropics. Again it was desirable to obtain contact with both highly\nisolated and, therefore, relatively primitive stocks for comparison\nwith modernized groups of the same stock. In order to accomplish this\nan expedition was made in 1934 to eight archipelagos of the Southern\nPacific to study groups of Melanesians and Polynesians. The Melanesians\ndescribed here were living in New Caledonia and the Fiji Islands.If the causative factors for the physical degeneration of\nmankind are practically the same everywhere, it should be possible to\nfind a common cause operating, regardless of climate, race, or\nenvironment.Owing to the vast extent of the Pacific waters and the limited\nnumber of transportation lines, it became very difficult to arrange a\nconvenient itinerary. This, however, was finally accomplished\nsatisfactorily by going southward through the more easterly\narchipelagos; namely, the Marquesas Islands, Society Islands and Cook\nIslands, then westward to the Tongan Islands in the southern central\nPacific near New Zealand, and then westward to New Caledonia near\nAustralia. From this group we went northward to the Fiji Islands, also\nin the western Pacific, then to the Samoan Islands in the central\nPacific south of the equator, and then to the Hawaiian Islands north of\nthe equator. These island groups were all populated by different racial\nstocks speaking different languages. The movements from archipelago to\narchipelago were made on the larger ships, and between the islands of\nthe group in small crafts, except in the Hawaiian Islands where an\naeroplane was used.The program in each group consisted in making contact with local\nguides and interpreters. They had generally been arranged for in\nadvance by correspondence with government officials. By these means we\nwere able to reach isolated groups in locations quite distant from\ncontact with trade or merchant ships. To reach these isolated groups\noften required going over rough and difficult trails since most of the\nislands being of volcanic formation are mountainous.On reaching the isolated groups our greetings and the purpose of\nthe mission were conveyed by our interpreters to the chiefs. Much time\nwas often lost in going through necessary ceremonials and feasting. In\nevery instance we received a very cordial reception and excellent\ncooperation. In no instance was there antagonism. Through the\nunderground telegraph they always seemed to know we were coming and had\nprepared for us. When these formalities were once over and our wishes\nmade known, the chiefs instructed the members of their tribes to carry\nout our program for making examinations, recording personal data,\nmaking photographs, and collecting samples of foods for chemical\nanalysis. The food samples were either dried or preserved in\nformalin.The detailed records for every individual included data on the\ntribe, village and family, his age, previous residence, physical\ndevelopment, the kinds of foods eaten, the physical condition of every\ntooth, including presence or absence of cavities; the shape of the\ndental arches; the shape and development of the face; and detailed\nnotes on divergencies from racial type. Special physical\ncharacteristics were photographed. A comparsion was made of these\nfactors for each of the more isolated members of the same tribe and\nthose in the vicinity of the port or landing place of the island.\nThrough the government officials detailed information was secured,\nusually in the form of the annual government statistical reports,\nshowing the kind and quantity of the various ingredients and articles\nthat were imported, and similarly those that were exported. Contact was\nmade in each island group with the health officers, and the studies\nwere usually made with their assistance. In many instances the only\ncontact with civilization had consisted of the call of a small trading\nship once or twice a year to gather up the copra or dried coconut, sea\nshells and such other products as the natives had accumulated for\nexchange. Payment for these products was usually made in trade goods\nand not in money. The following articles consisted nearly always of 90\nper cent of the total value: white flour and sugar. Ten per cent\nconsisted of wearing apparel or material for that apparel.While the missionaries have encouraged the people to adopt\nhabits of modern civilization, in the isolated districts the tribes\nwere not able to depart much from their native foods because of the\ninfrequency of the call of the trader ship. Effort had been made in\nalmost all of the islands to induce the natives to cover their bodies,\nespecially when in sight of strangers. In several islands regulatory\nmeasures had been adopted requiring the covering of the body. This\nregulation had greatly reduced the primitive practice of coating the\nsurface of the body with coconut oil, which had the effect of absorbing\nthe ultra-violet rays thus preventing injury from the tropical sun.\nThis coating of oil enabled them to shed the rain which was frequently\ntorrential though of short duration. The irradiation of the coconut oil\nwas considered by the natives to provide, in addition, an important\nsource of nutrition. Their newly acquired wet garments became a serious\nmenace to the comfort and health of the wearers.The early navigators who visited these South Sea Islands\nreported the people as being exceedingly strong, vigorously built,\nbeautiful in body and kindly disposed. There were formerly dense\npopulations on most of the inhabitable islands. In contrast with this,\none now finds that on many of the islands the death rate has come to so\nfar exceed the birth rate that the very existence of these racial\ngroups is often seriously threatened.The Island of New Caledonia is one of the largest of the\nPacific. It is situated in the vicinity of 23 degrees south latitude\nand 165 degrees east longitude. The New Caledonians are pure Melanesian\nstock. They are broad shouldererd, very muscular and in the past have\nbeen very warlike. These Islands are under French control. The foreign\npopulation is chiefly French, and limited mainly to the vicinity of the\none port of Noumea. The subjugation of these people has been very\ndifficult and as recently as 1917 a band from the interior in protest\nagainst efforts to establish a white colony and sugar plantation on a\ndesirable section of coastal land swept down on the French colony in\nthe night and massacred almost the entire population. Their contact\nwith the required foods from the sea had been cut off. They believe\nthey require sea foods to maintain life and physical efficiency. The\nphysical development of the primitive people including their teeth and\ndental arches is of very high order. A comparison of the individuals\nliving near the ports with those living in the isolated inland\nlocations shows marked increase in the incidence of dental caries. For\nthose living almost exclusively on the native foods the incidence of\ndental caries was only 0.14 per cent; while for those using trade foods\nthe incidence of dental caries was 26 per cent. The splendid facial and\ndental arch development of these quite primitive Caledonians is shown\nin Fig. 28. Note also their kinky hair and strong neck and face\nmuscles.FIG. 28. These Melanesians are\ntypical in general physical build and facial and dental arch form of\ntheir race which is spread over a wide area of Islands in the\nsoutheastern Pacific. The nutrition of all is adequate for them to\ndevelop and maintain their racial pattern.The Fiji Island group lies between 15 and 22 degrees south\nlatitude and between 177 degrees west and 175 degrees east longitude,\nthus straddling the international date line. The Fiji Islanders are\nsimilar in physical development and appearance to the New Caledonians,\nand like them are largely, if not wholly, Melanesian in racial origin.\nThe men have kinky hair and broad shoulders. In the past, they have\nbeen excellent warriors. They are not as tall as their hereditary\nenemies, the Tongans, to the east, and in order to make themselves look\nequally tall, they have adopted the practice of training their kinky\nhair straight out from the head to a height often reaching six or more\ninches. Typical facial and dental arch forms are shown in Fig. 29. They\nare British subjects, and where they have had supervision, in the\ndistricts near the ports and on those islands on which sugar\nplantations have been established, they have suffered very greatly from\nthe degenerative diseases.FIG. 29. The development of the\nfacial bones determines the size and shape of the palate and the size\nof the nasal air passages. Note the strength of the neck of the men\nabove and the well proportioned faces of the girls below. Such faces\nare usually associated with properly proportioned bodies. Tooth decay\nis rare in these mouths so long as they use an adequate selection of\nthe native foods.Since Viti Levu, one of the islands of this group, is one of the\nlarger islands of the Pacific Ocean, I had hoped to find on it a\ndistrict far enough from the sea to make it necessary for the natives\nto have lived entirely on land foods. Accordingly, with the assistance\nof the government officials and by using a recently opened government\nroad I was able to get well into the interior of the island by motor\nvehicle, and from this point to proceed farther inland on foot with two\nguides. I was not able, however, to get beyond the piles of sea shells\nwhich had been carried into the interior. My guide told me that it had\nalways been essential, as it is today, for the people of the interior\nto obtain some food from the sea, and that even during the times of\nmost bitter warfare between the inland or hill tribes and the coast\ntribes, those of the interior would bring down during the night choice\nplant foods from the mountain areas and place them in caches and return\nthe following night and obtain the sea foods that had been placed in\nthose depositories by the shore tribes. The individuals who carried\nthese foods were never molested, not even during active warfare. He\ntold me further that they require food from the sea at least every\nthree months, even to this day. This was a matter of keen interest, and\nat the same time disappointment since one of the purposes of the\nexpedition to the South Seas was to find, if possible, plants or fruits\nwhich together, without the use of animal products, were capable of\nproviding all of the requirements of the body for growth and for\nmaintenance of good health and a high state of physical efficiency.\nAmong the sources of animal foods was the wild pig from the bush. These\nwere not native, but imported into nearly all of the islands, and they\nhave become wild where there is an abundance of food for them. Another\nanimal food was that from coconut crabs which grow to a weight of\nseveral pounds. At certain seasons of the year the crabs migrate to the\nsea in great numbers from the mountains and interior country. They\nspend about three days in the sea for part of their reproductive\nprogram and return later to their mountain habitats. Their routes of\ntravel are as nearly as possible in straight lines. At the season of\nmigration, large numbers of the crabs are captured for food. These\ncrabs rob the coconut trees of fruit. They climb the trees during the\ndarkness and return to the ground before the dawn. They cut off the\ncoconuts and allow them to drop to the ground. When the natives hear\ncoconuts dropping in the night they put a girdle of grass around the\ntree fifteen or twenty feet from the ground, and when the crabs back\ndown and touch the grass they think that they are down on the ground,\nlet go their hold and are stunned by the fall. The natives then collect\nthe crabs and put them in a pen where they are fed on shredded coconut.\nIn two weeks' time the crabs are so fat that they burst their shells.\nThey are then very delicious eating. Fresh water fish of various kinds\nare used where available from the mountain streams. Land animal foods,\nhowever, are not abundant in the mountainous interior, and no places\nwere found where the native plant foods were not supplemented by sea\nfoods.Our first visit to the Fiji Islands was in 1934,\nand the second in 1936. On our first trip we had much personal\nassistance from Ratu Popi, hereditary king. His residence was on the\nroyal island reserved exclusively for the king and his retinue. His\npicture is shown in Fig. 30 with that of Mrs. Price. He was very\nsolicitous for the welfare of his people whom he recognized to be\nrapidly breaking down with modernization. The council house is also\nshown in Fig. 30. He gave us very important information regarding the\norigin of cannibalism, relating it to a recognition of special food\nvalues of special organs, particularly the livers.FIG. 30. The building above is\nthe Fiji Council house and shows the typical form of native\narchitecture; no nails or bolts are used. It is located on the King's\nIsland Mbau. The hereditary monarch, Ratu Popi is seen with Mrs. Price.\nNote his splendid features. Beneath his coat he wears a native skirt\nand is barefooted.There has been a very extensive development of sugar plantations\non the larger islands of several of the Pacific archipelagos. The\nworking of these plantations has required the importation of large\nnumbers of indentured laborers. These have been brought chiefly from\nIndia and China. Since they are nearly all men, those who have married\nhave obtained their wives from among the natives. This, the Chinese\nhave done quite frequently. Since they are excellent workers they\nprovide good homes and are good business men. They are, in many\ndistricts, rapidly becoming the landowners and are men of influence.\nThis influx of Asiatics, together with that of Europeans, has had an\nimportant influence upon the purity of the native race around the ports\nand provided an opportunity to study the effect of intermingling of\nraces upon the susceptibility to dental caries. No differences in\nextent of tooth decay due to ancestry were disclosed. The incidence of\ndental caries at the points of contact with imported foods was 30.1 per\ncent of teeth examined as compared with 0.42 for the more isolated\ngroups living on the native foods of land and sea.The physical changes which were found associated with the use of\nthe imported foods included the loss of immunity to dental caries in\npractically all of the individuals who had displaced their native foods\nvery largely with the modern foods. Dental caries was much worse,\nhowever, in the growing children and motherhood group due to the\nspecial demands of these individuals. These conditions are illustrated\nin Figs. 31 and 32. The boy shown in Fig. 32 (upper, left) typifies the\nsuffering brought by modernization. Abscessed teeth often cause\nsuicide.FIG. 31. These natives of the\nFiji Islands illustrate the effect of changing from the native food to\nthe imported foods of commerce. Tooth decay becomes rampant and with it\nis lost the ability to properly masticate the food. Growing children\nand child bearing mothers suffer most severely from dental\ncaries.FIG. 32. No dentists or\nphysicians are available on most of these islands. Toothache is the\nonly cause of suicide. The new generation born after the parents adopt\nthe imported modern foods often have a change in the shape of the face\nand dental arches. The teeth are crowded as shown\nbelow.Another important phase of the studies included a critical\nexamination of the facial form and shape of the dental arches which\ninclude very definite and typical changes represented by the narrowing\nof the features and the lengthening of the face with crowding of the\nteeth in the arch. These are illustrated in the lower half of Fig.\n32.The members of the Melanesian race living on the Fiji Islands of\nthe Pacific, whether volcanic or coral in origin, have developed a very\nhigh immunity to dental caries and well formed faces and dental arches.\nTheir native foods consisted of animal life from the sea eaten with\nplants and fruits from the land in accordance with a definite program\nof food selection. In their primitive state only 0.42 per cent of their\nteeth were attacked by tooth decay. In the modernized groups this\nincidence increased to 30.1 per cent. The change in the nutrition\nincluded a marked reduction in the native foods and their displacement\nwith white-flour products, sugar and sweetened goods, canned foods and\npolished rice. In the succeeding generations after the parents had\nadopted the modern foods, there occurred distinct change in facial form\nand shape of the dental arches.TABLE OF CONTENTSChapter 8ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED\nPOLYNESIANSTHE characteristics of the Polynesian race\nincluded straight hair, oval features, happy, buoyant dispositions and\nsplendid physiques. When the Pacific Islands were discovered the\nPolynesians were found inhabiting the Hawaiian Islands, the Marquesas\nIslands, the Tuamotu group including Tahiti, the Cook Islands, the\nTongan Islands and the Samoan group.The first group studied was made up of the people of the\nMarquesas Islands which are situated 9 degrees south latitude and 140\ndegrees west longitude, about 4,000 miles due west of Peru. Few, if\nany, of the primitive racial stocks of the South Sea Islands were so\nenthusiastically extolled for their beauty and excellence of physical\ndevelopment by the early navigators. Much tooth decay prevails today.\nThey reported the Marquesans as vivacious, happy people numbering over\na hundred thousand on the seven principal islands of this group.\nProbably in few places in the world can so distressing a picture be\nseen today as is found there. A French government official told me that\nthe native population had decreased to about two thousand, chiefly as a\nresult of the ravages of tuberculosis. Serious epidemics of small-pox\nand measles have at times taken a heavy toll. In a group of\napproximately one hundred adults and children I counted ten who were\nemaciated and coughing with typical signs of tuberculosis. Many were\nwaiting for treatment at a dispensary eight hours before the hour it\nopened. In the past some of the natives have had splendid physiques,\nfine countenances, and some of the women have had beautiful features.\nThey are now a sick and dying primitive group. A trader ship was in\nport exchanging white flour and sugar for their copra. They have\nlargely ceased to depend on the sea for food. Tooth decay was rampant.\nAt the time of the examination, 36.9 per cent of the teeth of the\npeople using trade food in conjunction with the land plants and fruits\nhad been attacked by tooth decay. The individuals living entirely on\nnative foods were few. Some early navigators were so highly impressed\nwith the beauty and health of these people that they reported the\nMarquesas Islands as the Garden of Eden. Tahiti is the principal island\nof the Society group. It is situated 17 degrees south of the equator,\n149 degrees west longitude. Fortunately degeneration has not been so\nrapid nor so severe here. The Tahitian population, however, has reduced\nfrom over two hundred thousand as early estimated, to a present native\npopulation estimated at about ten thousand. These islands are also a\npart of French Oceania. Many of the able bodied men were taken from\nthese French Islands to France to fight in the World War. Only a small\npercentage, however, returned, and they were mostly crippled and\nmaimed. The Tahitians are a buoyant, light-hearted race, fully\nconscious, however, of their rapid decline in numbers and health. Many\nof the more primitive are very fine looking and have excellent dental\narches, as seen in Fig. 33.FIG. 33. Polynesians are a\nbeautiful race and physically sturdy. They have straight hair and their\ncolor is often that of a sun tanned European. They have perfect dental\narches.The capital of Tahiti, Papeete, is the administrative center for\nthe French Pacific possessions. It has a large foreign population, and\nthere is considerable commerce in and out of this port. Much imported\nfood is used. Like on the Marquesas Islands, it was difficult to find\nlarge numbers of individuals living entirely on the native foods. Those\nthat were found had complete immunity to dental caries. For the natives\nliving in part on trade foods, chiefly white flour, sugar and canned\ngoods, 31.9 per cent of the teeth were found to be attacked by tooth\ndecay. Typical extensive destruction of the teeth amongst the\nmodernized Tahitians is shown in Fig. 34. There is a large colony of\nChinese in Tahiti, brought there as indentured laborers. They have not\nreturned. When the Tahitian men did not return from the war, their\nwives married the Chinese, who are good workers.FIG. 34. Wherever the native\nfoods have been displaced by the imported foods, dental caries becomes\nrampant. These are typical modernized Tahitians.The Cook Islands are British and under the direct guidance of\nthe New Zealand Government. Rarotonga is the principal island. It is\nsituated in the Pacific Ocean in the vicinity of 21 degrees south\nlatitude and 160 degrees west longitude. It has a delightful climate\nthe year around. Racially according to legend, the Maori tribe, the\nnative tribe of New Zealand, migrated there from the Cook Islands. In\naddition to being similar in physical development and appearance, their\nlanguages are sufficiently similar so that each can understand the\nother, even though their separation occurred probably over a thousand\nyears ago.It is a matter of great importance that the inhabitants of these\nSouth Sea Islands were skillful navigators and boat builders. It was a\ncommon occurrence for expeditions both peaceful and aggressive to make\njourneys of one and two thousand miles in crafts propelled by man power\nand wind and carrying in addition an adequate supply of water and food\nfor their journey.A large number were found in Rarotonga living almost entirely on\nnative foods, and only 0.3 per cent of the teeth of these individuals\nhave been attacked by dental caries. In the vicinity of Avarua, the\nprincipal port, however, the natives were living largely on trade\nfoods, and among these 29.5 per cent of the teeth were found to have\nbeen attacked by dental caries. In Fig. 35 (top) are seen typically\nfine faces and teeth. However at the lower left is shown a child at the\nport whose parents were living on the imported food. This boy's upper\nlateral teeth are erupting inside the arch. In the lower right is a\nchild with normal spacing of the deciduous teeth.FIG. 35. These Polynesians live\non the island of Rarotonga. At the top are two examples of typically\nfine faces and teeth. Below, at left, is seen a full blood Polynesian\nchild with the dental arch so small that the permanent laterals are\ndeveloping inside the arch. His parents used imported food. At the\nright below is a mixed blood of white and Polynesian. Note the normal\nspacing of the temporary teeth before the permanent set appears.\nParents used native foods.Under British guidance the Cook Islanders have much better\nhealth than the Marquesans or the Tahitians. Their population is not\nseriously decreasing, and is untroubled except for the progressive\ndevelopment of the degenerative diseases around the port. They are\nthrifty and happy, and are rapidly developing a local culture including\na school system supported by natives.The inhabitants of the Tongan Islands, the principal of which is\nTongatabu, are Polynesian. This group, containing over 100 islands, is\nsituated between 18 and 22 degrees south latitude and between 173 and\n176 degrees west longitude, and has a native population of about\n28,000. They have the distinction of being one of the last absolute\nmonarchies of the world. While they are under the protection of Great\nBritain, they largely manage their own affairs. Their isolation is\nnearly complete except for a call from an infrequent trader. They seem\nto be credited by the inhabitants of the other islands as being the\ngreatest warriors of the Pacific. The Tongans at least acknowledge that\nthey are the greatest warriors, and indeed the greatest people of the\nworld. They will not step aside to allow anyone to pass since they say\nthat when the world was created and populated they were the first to be\nmade, next was the pig, and last the white man. Ethnologically, they\nare said to be a mixture of the darker Melanesians with their kinky\nhair, and the fairer Polynesians of the eastern archipelagos with\nstraight hair. It is said they have never been defeated in battle. For\ncenturies they and the Fijian tribes 700 miles to the west have\nfrequently been at war. The British government has very skillfully\ndirected this racial rivalry into athletics. While we were in the Fiji\nIslands the British government provided a battle cruiser to carry the\nfootball team from Fiji to Nukualofa for the annual contest of\nstrength.These islanders have practiced eugenics by selecting tall strong\nmates. The queen of the islands was six feet three inches in\nheight.The limited importation of foods to the Tongan Islands due to\nthe infrequent call of merchant or trading ships has required the\npeople to remain largely on their native foods. Following the war,\nhowever, the price of copra went up from $40.00 per ton to $400.00,\nwhich brought trading ships with white flour and sugar to exchange for\nthe copra. The effect of this is shown very clearly in the condition of\nthe teeth. The incidence of dental caries among the isolated groups\nliving on native foods was 0.6 per cent, while for those around the\nport living in part on trade foods, it is 33.4 per cent. The effect of\nthe imported food was clearly to be seen on the teeth of the people who\nwere in the growth stage at that time. Now the trader ships no longer\ncall and this forced isolation is very clearly a blessing in disguise.\nDental caries has largely ceased to be active since imported foods\nbecame scarce, for the price of copra fell to $4.00 a ton. The\ntemporary rise in tooth decay was apparently directly associated with\nthe calling of trader ships.The Samoan Islands are located in the vicinity of 14 degrees\nsouth latitude and between 166 and 174 degrees west longitude. The\nnative population of the Samoan Islands is Polynesian. The control of\nthe Islands is divided between two governments. The eastern group is\nAmerican. The western group is British since the World War, before\nwhich it was under German control. The western group is now under a\nmandate to New Zealand. Through the kindness of the Governor and Naval\nOfficers of American Samoa transportation was provided on an auxiliary\ncraft to the various islands of the American Samoan group. We were\nparticularly indebted to Commander Stephenson, Director of Health,\nwhose guests we were, for continued personal assistance in making\nfavorable contacts in nearly all villages of the American Samoan group.\nIn no islands of the Pacific did we find so excellent an organization\nfor health service. Dispensaries have been established within reach of\nnearly all the villages besides hospital service at Pago Pago, the port\nof Tutuila. This is the finest port in the Pacific Ocean.\nNotwithstanding the regular monthly contact through merchant ships to\nand from America and Australia, many isolated groups were found living\nlargely on the native foods. A dental survey had recently been made of\nthis group by Lieutenant Commander Ferguson.(1)The excellent facial and dental arch development of the Samoans\nis illustrated in the upper half of Fig. 36. The change in facial and\ndental arch form which follows the use of modern food by the parents is\nshown in the lower half of Fig. 36. Note the marked irregularity of the\nteeth. This is one of the few groups of islands in which the population\nis not rapidly decreasing, indeed there is some increase. The Navy\npersonnel includes one dentist. Practically all his time is required\nfor the personnel and families of the Navy at this station.\nAccordingly, he can do only a limited amount of emergency service such\nas extractions for the natives. About 90 per cent of the inhabitants of\nAmerican Samoa are on the largest island, Tutuila, and due to the\ndevelopment of roads, a considerable number of the people have access\nto the main port, to which several of them come on ship days to sell\ntheir wares and to buy provisions to augment their native foods. The\nincidence of dental caries among those individuals living in part on\nimported foods at the port as compared with those in remote districts\nliving on native foods was as follows: Those almost exclusively on\nnative foods had 0.3 per cent of the teeth attacked by dental caries,\nand for those on trade foods, 18.7 per cent. Sea foods used here\ninclude many shell fish which are gathered and sold largely by the\nyoung people. The octopus, the sea crab and the beche-de-mere eaten raw\nwere used.FIG. 36. Note the marked\ndifference in facial and dental arch form of the two Samoan primitives\nabove and the two modernized below. The face bones are underdeveloped\nbelow causing a marked constriction of the arches with crowding of the\nteeth. This is a typical expression of inadequate nutrition of the\nparents.The Hawaiian Islands lie between 18 and 22 degrees north\nlatitude and between 154 and 160 degrees west longitude. These Islands\nare quite unlike any of the other Pacific Island groups previously\ndiscussed. Sugar and pineapple plantations cover vast areas and\ntogether constitute by far the most important industries of these\nIslands. In many districts the population is almost entirely foreign or\nof various blends, chiefly of Filipinos and Japanese with Hawaiians.\nThere is a large American population and a considerable European. These\ndifferent racial groups have largely brought their own customs which\nare rapidly submerging the native customs. Since the native population\nis so greatly reduced in comparison with the foreign population, and\nbecause intermarrying has been so general, it was difficult to find\nlarge groups of relatively pure-blooded Hawaiians either living almost\nentirely on native foods or on modernized foods. Though the number of\nthe individuals in these groups is accordingly not large, important\ndata were obtained for comparing the relative incidence of dental\ncaries and other degenerative processes. While the preparation of foods\non the various Pacific Islands has many common factors, all natives\nusing the underground oven of hot stones for cooking, the Hawaiian\nIslands present one unique difference in the method of preparation of\ntheir taro. They cook the root as do all the other tribes, but having\ndone so they dry the taro, powder it and mix it with water and allow it\nto ferment for several hours, usually twenty-four or more. This\npreparation called \"poi\" becomes slightly tart by the process of\nfermentation and has the consistency of heavy strap molasses or a very\nheavy cream. It is eaten by rolling it up on one or two fingers and\nsucking it from them. It accordingly offers no resistance to the\nprocess of mastication. In the districts where the natives are living\non native foods the incidence of dental caries was only 2 per cent of\nthe teeth, whereas among those natives who are living in large part on\nthe imported foods, chiefly white flour and sweetened goods, 37.3 per\ncent of the teeth had been attacked by tooth decay. Typical Hawaiian\nfaces are seen in Fig. 37. Typical modern tooth decay is shown in Fig.\n38. This girl has tuberculosis also.FIG. 37. Wherever the\nPolynesians are being modernized a change is occurring in facial form\nwhich is progressively more severe in the younger members of the\nfamily. These girls of an Hawaiian family demonstrate this. Note the\nchange in facial form in the sister to the right. The face is longer\nand narrower, the nostrils pinched and the chin is receding. The tribal\nfacial pattern is lost.FIG. 38. The Polynesian race is\nrapidly disappearing with modernization. Tooth decay becomes extreme as\nshown in the girl above. This girl has tuberculosis, one of the\nphysical injuries which accompany modernization. This is one of the\nbodily injuries as we will see later.The study of the incidence of dental caries in these various\nSouth Sea Island groups in its relation to diet was only one of several\nof the problems investigated. Since nutrition is the principal factor\nthat has been found related to the r6le of immunity and susceptibility\nto dental caries in my previous field studies, the collection of foods\nfor chemical analysis and the gathering of detailed data regarding the\narticles of diet have been very important phases of the activities of\nthis group of studies.Data were collected for relating the incidence of irregularities\nof the teeth and dental arches to the types of nutrition. Similarly,\nstudies were made of the individuals who had been hospitalized, in the\nfew places where hospitals existed, chiefly to obtain data regarding\nthe classification of the individuals who were suffering from\ntuberculosis. These were similar to the studies that I have made among\nthe Eskimos and Indians of Alaska and northern and central Canada.If one will picture a community of several thousand people with\nan average of 30 per cent of all the teeth attacked by dental caries\nand not a single dentist or dental instrument available for assistance\nof the entire group, a slight realization is had of the mass suffering\nthat has to be endured. Commerce and trade for profit blaze the way in\nbreaking down isolation's barriers, far in advance of the development\nof health agencies and emergency relief unwittingly made necessary by\nthe trade contact.While dental caries was most active in the periods of systematic\noverloads, such as growth, gestation and lactation, even the splendidly\nformed teeth of the adult men were wrecked by dental caries when the\nnative foods were displaced with modern foods. In all of the groups\nliving on native foods with a liberal intake of animal life of the sea,\nthe health of the gums was generally excellent. When, however, the sea\nfoods were quite limited in the dietary, heavy deposits formed and\noften were associated with a marked destruction of the supporting\ntissues with gingival infection. This condition was particularly\nprevalent among all groups near the ports, when the groups were\ndisplacing part of their native foods with imported foods.In American Samoa through the cooperation of the educational\nauthorities and the Director of the Department of Health, Commander\nStephenson, and under the direct supervision of Lieutenant Commander\nLowry, the dental surgeon, a group of four young men of the native\nteaching staff was selected and given instructions for the removal of\nthe deposits. Equipment in the form of instruments has since been\nprovided, in part through the kindness and generosity of some dental\nmanufacturers. This probably constitutes the only native dental service\nthat has ever been available in any of the Pacific Island groups. The\nintelligence and aptness with which these men were able to learn the\nfundamental principles, and their skill in carrying out a highly\ncommendable prophylactic operation was indeed remarkable. I gave them\npieces of soap and asked them to carve a reproduction of an extracted\ntooth which was given as a model and in which they were required to\nincrease all diameters to a given amount. Their work would probably\nequal if not exceed in excellence that of the first effort of 90 per\ncent of American dental students. Many of these natives are very\ndexterous with their fingers and are skilled artists in carving wood\nand other material.A great service could be rendered to these people who are in the\nprocess of modernization, but who have no opportunity for dental\nassistance, by teaching some of the bright young men certain of the\nprocedures for rendering first aid. They could be compensated by\ncontributions of native foods and native wares much as our itinerant\ndentists were in earlier days. The people would not have money to pay\nan American or European dentist for his service until trade is carried\non with currency.Nearly all these racial stocks are magnificent singers for which\nNature has well-equipped them physically. Their artistry can be judged\nby the fact that they sing very difficult music unaccompanied and\nundirected. A large native chorus at Nukualofa, in the Tongan Group,\nsang without accompaniment \"The Hallelujah Chorus\" from Handel's\nMessiah with all the parts and with phenominal volume and modulation.\nMuch of their work, such as rowing their largest boats, and many of\ntheir sports are carried out to the rhythm of hilarious music.Many of the island groups recognize that their races are doomed\nsince they are melting away with degenerative diseases, chiefly\ntuberculosis. Their one overwhelming desire is that their race shall\nnot die out. They know that something serious has happened since they\nhave been touched by civilization. Surely our civilization is on trial\nboth at home and abroad.The nutrition of the primitive Polynesians is continually\nreinforced with animal life from the sea which includes both soft- and\nhard-shell forms. The incidence of tooth decay varied from 0.6 per cent\nfor the most isolated groups to 33.4 per cent for the modernized\ngroups. Those individuals living in their native environment on their\nnative foods have universally normal facial and dental arch form\nreproducing the characteristics of the race. Those living on the normal\nenvironment except for using the imported foods of white flour, sugar,\nsugar products, syrup, polished rice, and the like, have in the\nsucceeding generations marked changes in facial and dental arch\nforms.REFERENCEFERGUSON, R. A. A dental survey of the school children of American\nSamoa.J. Am. Dent. A.,21:534, 1934.TABLE OF CONTENTSChapter 9ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED AFRICAN\nTRIBESAFRICA has been the last of the large\ncontinents to be invaded and explored by our modern civilization. It\nhas one of the largest native populations still living in accordance\nwith inherited traditions. Accordingly, it provides a particularly\nfavorable field for studying primitive racial stocks.This study of primitive racial stocks, with the exception of\nsome Indian groups, has been largely concerned with people living under\nphysical conditions quite different from those which obtain in the\ncentral area of a large continent.Sea foods are within reach of the inhabitants of islands and\ncoastal. regions regardless of latitude. The inhabitants of the\ninterior of a continent, however, have not access to liberal supplies\nof various forms of animal life of the sea. It was important,\ntherefore, in the interest of the inhabitants of the United States,\nCanada, Europe, and other large continental interiors, to study\nprimitive people living under environments similar to theirs. Africa is\none of the few countries that can provide both primitive living\nconditions and the modern life of the plains and plateau country in the\ninterior. The great plateau of eastern and central Africa has nurtured\na score of tribes with superb physiques and much accumulated wisdom. We\nare concerned to know how they have accomplished this, and whether they\nor any other people can survive in that environment after adopting the\nformulas of our modern civilizations. Considering that the most\nuniversal scourge of modern civilization is dental caries, though it is\nonly one of its many degenerative processes, it is important that we\nstudy these people to note how they have solved the major problems of\nliving in so severe and disciplining an environment as provided in\nAfrica.This was done during the summer of 1935. Our route took us\nthrough the Red Sea and down the Indian Ocean to enter the African\ncontinent at Mombasa below the equator and then across Kenya and Uganda\ninto Eastern Belgian Congo, and thence about 4,000 miles down the long\nstretch of the Nile through Sudan to the modernized civilization of\nEgypt. This journey covered most of the country around Ethiopia and\ngave us contact with several of the most primitive racial stocks of\nthat country. These people are accordingly the neighbors of the\nAbyssinians or Ethiopians. Since the various tribes speak different\nlanguages and are under different governments, it was necessary to\norganize our safari in connection with the local government officials\nin the different districts.During these journeys in Africa which covered about 6,000 miles,\nwe came in contact with about thirty different tribes. Special\nattention was given to the foods, samples of which were obtained for\nchemical analysis. Over 2,500 negatives were made and developed in the\nfield. If any one impression of our experiences were to be selected as\nparticularly vivid, it would be the contrast between the health and\nruggedness of the primitives in general and that of the foreigners who\nhave entered their country. That their superior ruggedness was not\nracial became evident when through contact with modern civilizations\ndegenerative processes developed. Very few of the many Europeans with\nwhom we came in contact had lived in central Africa for as much as two\nyears without serious illness or distinct evidence of physical stress.\nThat the cause was not the severity of the climate, but something\nrelated to the methods of living, was soon apparent. In all the\ndistricts it was recognized and expected that the foreigners must plan\nto spend a portion of every few years or every year outside that\nenvironment if they would keep well. Children born in that country to\nEuropeans were generally expected to spend several of their growing\nyears in Europe or America if they would build even relatively normal\nbodies.One exacting condition of the environment that we encountered\nwas the constant exposure to disease. Dysentery epidemics were so\nsevere and frequent that we scarcely allowed ourselves to eat any food\nthat had not been cooked or that we had not peeled ourselves. In\ngeneral, it was necessary to boil all drinking water. We dared not\nallow our bare feet to touch a floor of the ground for fear of jiggers\nwhich burrow into the skin of the feet. Scarcely ever when below 6,000\nfeet were we safe after sundown to step from behind mosquito netting or\nto go out without thorough protection against the malaria pests. These\nmalaria mosquitoes which include many varieties are largely night\nfeeders. They were thought to come out soon after sundown. We were\nadvised that the most dangerous places for becoming infected were the\npublic eating houses, since the mosquitoes hide under the tables and\nattack the diner's ankles if they are not adequately protected. We\nrigidly followed the precaution of providing adequate protection\nagainst these pests. Disease-carrying ticks were so abundant in the\ngrass and shrubbery that we had to be on guard constantly to remove\nthem from our clothing before they buried themselves in our flesh. They\nwere often carriers of very severe fevers. We had to be most careful\nnot to touch the hides with which the natives protected their bodies\nfrom the cold at night and from the sun in the daytime without thorough\nsterilization following any contact. There was grave danger from the\nlice that infected the hair of the hides. We dared not enter several\ndistricts because of the dreaded tsetse fly and the sleeping sickness\nit carries. One wonders at the apparent health of the natives until he\nlearns of the unique immunity they have developed and which is largely\ntransmitted to the offspring. In several districts we were told that\npractically every living native had had typhus fever and was immune,\nthough the lice from their bodies could transmit the disease. One also\nwonders why people with such resistance to disease are not able to\ncombat the degenerative diseases of modern civilization. When they\nadopt modern civilization they then become susceptible to several of\nour modern degenerative processes, including tooth decay.Dr. Anderson who is in charge of a splendid government hospital\nin Kenya, assured me that in several years of service among the\nprimitive people of that district he had observed that they did not\nsuffer from appendicitis, gall bladder trouble, cystitis and duodenal\nulcer. Malignancy was also very rare among the primitives.It is of great significance that we studied six tribes in which\nthere appeared to be not a single tooth attacked by dental caries nor a\nsingle malformed dental arch. Several other tribes were found with\nnearly complete immunity to dental caries. In thirteen tribes we did\nnot meet a single individual with irregular teeth. Where the members of\nthese same tribes had adopted modern civilization many cases of tooth\ndecay were found. In the next generation following the adoption of the\nEuropean dietaries dental arch deformities frequently developed.We are concerned to know something of the origin of these people\nincluding the Ethiopians and to what extent racial ancestry has\nprotected them. If we refer to an ethnographic map of African races we\nfind there is evidence of a great movement northward from South Africa.\nThese people had some things in common with the Melanesians and\nPolynesians of the South Pacific whom we studied the year previously.\nTheir language carries some words of similar meaning. While there are\nmany tribes existing today, it is of significance that they each\npossess some identifying characteristics of language, dress and food\nhabits. Another great racial movement has apparently moved southward\nfrom Northern Africa. These tribes are of Hamitic origin and include\nNilotic tribes and Abyssinians. The Nilotic tribes have a distinct\nphysical pattern and mode of life. These great racial movements have\nmet in the Upper Nile region of Eastern Africa near the equator, and\nhave swayed back and forth with successive obliteration or absorption\nof those tribes that were least sturdy. The negro race occupied an area\nacross Africa from the West to Central Africa. They were exposed to the\naggression and oppression of these two great racial movements,\nresulting often in intermingling in various proportions of racial\nbloods. The Semitic race, chiefly Arabs, occupied Arabia and a great\narea in Northern Africa.In this bird's eye view we are observing changes that have been\nin progress during many hundreds or thousands of years. The Arabs have\nbeen the principal slave dealers working in from the east coast of\nAfrica. They have maintained their individuality without much blending\nexcept on the coast. They have not become an important part of the\nnative stock of the interior. These primitive native stocks can be\nlargely identified on the basis of their habits and methods of living.\nThe Nilotic tribes have been chiefly herders of cattle and goats and\nhave lived primarily on dairy products, including milk and blood, with\nsome meat, and with a varying percentage of vegetable foods. It was\nmost interesting to observe that in every instance these cattle people\ndominated the surrounding tribes. They were characterized by superb\nphysical development, great bravery and a mental acumen that made it\npossible for them to dominate because of their superior intelligence.\nAmong these Nilotic tribes the Masai forced their way farthest south\nand occupy a position between two of the great Bantu tribes, the Kikuyu\nand the Wakamba. Both of these latter tribes are primarily agricultural\npeople.Masai Tribe.The Masai are tall and strong. Fig. 39 shows\na typical belle, also a Masai man who is much taller than our six-foot\nguide. It is interesting to study the methods of living and observe the\naccumulated wisdom of the Masai. They are reported to have known for\nover two hundred years that malaria was carried by mosquitoes, and\nfurther they have practiced exposing the members of their tribes who\nhad been infected with syphilis by the Arabs to malaria to prevent the\nserious injuries resulting from the spirochetal infection. Yet modern\nmedicine boasts of being the discoverers of this great principle of\nusing malaria to prevent or relieve syphilitic infections of the spinal\ncord and brain.FIG 39 These members of the\nMasai tribe illustrate the splendid nutrition provided by their diet of\ncattle products namely: meat, milk and blood. The chief beside our\nguide is well over six feet. This Masai belle wears the customary\ndecorations of coils of copper wire bracelets and anklets which largely\nconstitute the attire of the girls.I saw the native Masai operating on their cattle with skill and\nknowledge. The Masai have no currency and all their transactions are\nmade with cows or goats. A valuable cow was not eating properly, and I\nobserved them taking a thorn out of the inside of her mouth. The\nsurgical operation was done with a knife of their own making and\ntempered by pounding. The wound was treated by rubbing it with the\nashes of a plant that acted as a very powerful styptic. Their knowledge\nof veterinary science is quite remarkable. I saw them treating a young\ncow that had failed to conceive. They apparently knew the cause and\nproceeded to treat her as modern veterinaries might do in order to\novercome her difficulties. For their food throughout the centuries they\nhave depended very largely on milk, meat and blood, reinforced with\nvegetables and fruits. They milk the cows daily and bleed the steers at\nregular intervals by a unique process. In Fig. 40 we see a native Masai\nwith his bow and arrow, the latter tipped with a sharp knife which is\nguarded by a shoulder to determine the depth to which the arrow may\nenter the vein. If the animal is sufficiently tame, the blood is drawn\nwhile it is standing. If the animal is frightened it is quickly\nhobbled, as shown below. In this figure the stream of blood may be seen\nspurting from the jugular vein into a gourd which holds about a gallon.\nA torque is placed around the neck before the puncture is made. The\nanimals did not even flinch when struck by the arrow, the operation is\ndone so quickly and skillfully. When sufficient blood was drawn, the\ntorque was removed and the blood immediately stopped flowing. A styptic\nmade of ashes referred to above was used. This serves also to protect\nthe wound from infection. The blood is defibrinated by whipping in the\ngourd. The fibrin is fried or cooked much as bacon or meat would be\nprepared. The defibrinated blood is used raw just as the milk is,\nexcept in smaller quantities. When available, each growing child\nreceives a day's ration of blood as does each pregnant or lactating\nwoman. Formerly, the warriors used this food exclusively. These three\nsources, milk, blood and meat provide them with liberal supplies of\nbody-building minerals and the special vitamins, both fat-soluble and\nwater soluble. Their estimate of a desirable dairy stock is based on\nquality not quantity. They judge the value of a cow for keeping in\ntheir herd by the length of time it takes her calf to stand on its feet\nand run after it is born, which is only a very few minutes. This is in\nstriking contrast with the practice of our modern dairymen who are\nchiefly concerned with the quantity of milk and quantity of butter fat\nrather than with its value as a source of special factors for\nnutrition. Many of the calves of the modern high-production cows of\ncivilized countries are not able to stand for many hours after birth,\nfrequently twenty-four. This ability to stand is very important in a\ncountry infested with predatory animals; such as lions, leopards,\nhyenas, jackals and vultures.FIG. 40. An important source of\nfat soluble vitamins during the drought period is the blood of the\nsteers which is drawn about every thirty days. Above shows the lance\ntipped arrow being shot into the neck vein. If the animal is wild it is\nhobbled as shown below where the stream of blood is seen spurting into\nthe gourd. The flow ceases when the compress is\nremoved.This reminded me of my experience in Alaska in studying the\nreindeer of the Eskimos. I was told that a reindeer calf could be\ndropped in a foot of snow and almost immediately it could run with such\nspeed that the predatory animals, including wolves, could not catch it.\nAnd, moreover, that these fawns would go almost immediately after their\nbirth with a herd on a stampede and never be knocked down.The problem of combating the predatory animals, particularly the\nlions, calls for greater skill and bravery than is required by other\ntribes in Africa. The lions live on the large grazing animals,\nparticularly the cattle, from which they select the strongest. In\ndriving over the veldt we frequently saw one or two men or boys\nguarding an entire herd with only their spears. Their skill in killing\na lion with a spear is one of the most superb of human achievements. I\nwas interested to learn that they much prefer their locally made spears\nto those that are manufactured outside and brought in, because of their\ncertainty that they will not break, will withstand straightening\nregardless of how much they are bent and because due to the process of\nmanufacture will take a very sharp edge.On one occasion, after we had been kept awake much of the night\nby the roaring of the lions and neighing of the zebras that were being\nattacked by the lions, we visited a Masai manyata nearby in the morning\nto learn that when they let their cattle and goats out of the corral of\nacacia thorns, three or four spearsmen went ahead in search of the\nlions that might be waiting to ambush the cattle. They apparently did\nnot have the slightest fear. The lions evidentally had made a kill\nnearby. This the natives determined by the number of coyotes.The heart and courage of these people has been largely broken by\nthe action of the government in taking away their shields in order to\nprevent them pillaging the surrounding native tribes as formerly. They\ndepended upon their shields to protect them from the arrows of the\nother tribes. The efforts to make agriculturists of these Masai people\nare not promising.In a typical manyata the chief has several wives. Each one has a\nseparate dwelling. Timber and shrubbery are so scarce in this vicinity\nthat the dwellings are built of clay mixed with cow dung which is\nplastered over a framework of twigs. Many chiefs are over six feet in\nheight.The Masai live in a very extensive game preserve in which\nhundreds of thousands of grazing animals enjoy an existence protected\nfrom man since even the natives are not allowed to kill the animals as\nformerly. They seemed to be preserved for the numerous lions which\noccasionally become very bold since they have an abundance of food and\nno enemies. Recently the local government authorities found it\nnecessary to shoot off eighty of the lions in a particular district\nbecause of their aggressiveness.In the Masai tribe, a study of 2,516 teeth in eighty-eight\nindividuals distributed through several widely separated manyatas\nshowed only four individuals with caries. These had a total of ten\ncarious teeth, or only 0.4 per cent of the teeth attacked by tooth\ndecay.Kikuyu Tribe, Kianzbu, Kenya.In contrast with the Masai,\nthe Kikuyu tribe, which inhabits a district to the west and north of\nthe Masai, are characterized by being primarily an agricultural people.\nTheir chief articles of diet are sweet potatoes, corn, beans, and some\nbananas, millet, and Kafir corn, a variety of Indian millet. The women\nuse special diets during gestation and lactation. The girls in this\ntribe, as in several others, are placed on a special diet for six\nmonths prior to marriage. They nurse their children for three harvests\nand precede each pregnancy with special feeding.The Kikuyus are not as tall as the Masai and physically they are\nmuch less rugged. Like many of the central African tribes, they remove\nsome lower incisors at the time these permanent teeth erupt. This\ncustom is reported to have been established for the purpose of feeding\nthe individuals in case of lock-jaw. One of the striking tribal customs\nis the making of large perforations in the ears in which they carry\nmany metal ornaments. A typical Kikuyu woman is shown in Fig. 41 (upper\nright). Typical Kikuyu men are also shown in Fig. 41. Note their fine\nteeth and dental arches.FIG. 41. The development of the\nfaces and dental arches in many African tribes is superb. The girl at\nthe upper right is wearing several earrings in the lobe of each ear.\nThe Wakamba tribe points the teeth as shown below. This does not cause\ntooth decay while they live on their native food.A study of 1,041 teeth in thirty-three individuals showed\nfifty-seven teeth with caries, or 5.5 per cent. These were 36.4 per\ncent of the individuals affected.Much of the territory occupied by the Kikuyu tribes was formerly\nforest. Their practice has been to burn down a section of forest in\norder to get new lands for planting. As soon as the virgin fertility is\nexhausted, which is usually in three to five years, they burn down\nanother section of forest. By this process they have largely denuded\ntheir section of Kenya of its timber. This has resulted in a great\nwaste of building material. There are few stands of native forest\nwithin easy reach of transportation.Wakamba Tribe, Kenya.The Wakamba tribe point their teeth\nas shown in Fig. 41. They occupy the territory to the east of the\nMasai, who in past centuries have driven themselves as a wedge between\nthe Kikuyu and the Wakamba tribes. The Masai until checked carried on a\nrelentless warfare, consisting largely of raids, in which they\nslaughtered the men and carried off the women and children and drove\naway the cattle or goats. The Wakambas are intellectually superior to\nthe Kikuyus and have distinct artistic skill in the carving of art\nobjects. They are mechanical and like machinery. Many of them have\nimportant positions in the shops of the Kenya and Uganda railway.An examination of 1,112 teeth of thirty-seven individuals showed\nsixty-nine teeth with caries, or 6.2 per cent. Twenty-one and\nsix-tenths per cent of the individuals studied had dental caries.Jalou Tribe, Kenya.This tribe occupies the territory\nalong Lake Victoria and Kisumu Bay. They are one of the most\nintelligent and physically excellent native tribes. They were studied\nin two groups, one at Maseno, and the other at Ogado.The group studied at the Maseno school were boys ranging from\nabout ten years to twenty-two, totaling about 190 in all. The principal\nof the school presented the boys in military formation for inspection.\nThrough him as interpreter I asked that all boys who had ever had\ntoothache hold up their hands, and nineteen did so. Of the nineteen\nonly one individual was found to have caries; two of his teeth were\ninvolved, which, out of 546 teeth for these individuals, gives 0.4 per\ncent of the teeth with caries.In the Ogada Mission a study of 258 teeth for ten individuals\nrevealed no teeth affected with dental caries.Jeannes School, Kenya.This school is located at Kabete.\nIt is an institution where young married couples are trained in\ndomestic science, agriculture, and similar subjects.In 388 teeth of thirteen individuals, thirty-one teeth were\nfound to have been attacked by dental caries, or 7.9 per cent. These\nwere in six individuals.Pumwani Mission School, Kenya.This is a native suburb of\nNairobi, and there the people have come under the influence of recent\nEuropean contact.In an examination of 588 teeth of twenty-one individuals\ntwenty-six teeth had caries, or 4.4 per cent.C. M. S. School, Nukuru, Kenya.The children of this\nschool belong to several tribes, chiefly Jalou. In a study of 312 teeth\nof eleven individuals, only one tooth was found to have been attacked\nby tooth decay, or 0.3 per cent.Chewya at Kisurnu, Kenya.The natives of this district\nbelong to the Maragoli tribe. They are very strong and physically well\ndeveloped. They live within easy reach of Lake Victoria from which they\nobtain large quantities of fish which constitutes an important part of\ntheir diet, together with cereals and sweet potatoes.A study of 552 teeth of nineteen individuals revealed only one\ntooth with dental caries, or 0.2 per cent.Muhima Tribe or Anchola, Uganda.This tribe resides in\nsouthern Uganda. They, like the Masai, are primarily a cattle raising\npeople and live on milk, blood and meat. The district in which they\nlive is to the east of Lake Edward and the Mountains of the Moon. They\nconstitute one of the very primitive and undisturbed groups. While the\nMasai raise chiefly the hump-backed cattle, the herds of this Muhima or\nAnchola tribe are characterized by their large wide-spread horns. Like\nthe Masai, they are tall and courageous. They defend their herds and\ntheir families from lions and leopards with their primitive spears.\nLike the other primitive cattle people, they dominate the adjoining\ntribes.In a study of 1,040 teeth of thirty-seven individuals, not a\nsingle tooth was found with dental caries. This tribe makes their huts\nof grass and sticks.Watusi Tribe.This is a very interesting tribe living on\nthe east of Lake Kivu, one of the headwaters of the West Nile in Ruanda\nwhich is a Belgian Protectorate. They are tall and athletic. Their\nfaces differ markedly from those of other tribes, and they boast a very\nnoble inheritance. According to legend, a Roman military expedition\npenetrated into central Africa at the time of Anthony and Cleopatra. A\nphalanx remained, refusing to return with the expedition. They took\nwives from the native tribes and passed laws that thereafter no\nmarriage could take place outside their group. They have magnificent\nphysiques. Many stand over six feet without shoes.Several of the tribes neighboring Ethiopia are agriculturists\nand grow corn, beans, millet, sweet potatoes, bananas, Kafir corn, and\nother grains, as their chief articles of food. Physically they are not\nas well built as either the tribes using dairy products liberally or\nthose using fish from the fresh water lakes and streams. They have been\ndominated because they possess less courage and resourcefulness.The Government of Kenya has for several years sponsored an\nathletic contest among the various tribes, the test being one of\nstrength for which they use a tug-of-war. One particular tribe has\ncarried off the trophy repeatedly. This tribe resides on the east coast\nof Lake Victoria and lives very largely on fish. The members are\npowerful athletes and wonderful swimmers. They are said not to have\nbeen conquered in warfare when they could take the warfare to the\nwater. One of their methods is to swim under water to the enemy's fleet\nand scuttle their boats. They fight with spears under water with\nmarvelous skill. Their physiques are magnificent. In a group of 190\nboys who had been gathered into a government school near the east coast\nof Lake Victoria only one boy was found with dental caries, and two of\nhis teeth had been affected. The people dry the fish which are carried\nfar inland.Uganda which lies to the north and west of Lake Victoria and\nwest of Kenya, is high and although on the equator, has an equitable\nclimate with an abundance of native foods. Two crops per year are\nproduced, and many varieties of bananas grow wild. The Buganda Tribe,\nUganda, is the chief tribe of this region. Uganda has been called the\nGarden of Eden of Africa because of its abundance of plant foods,\nchiefly bananas and sweet potatoes, and because of its abundance of\nfresh water fish and animal life. The natives are thrifty and mentally\nsuperior to those of most other districts. They have a king and a\nnative parliament which the British Government recognizes and entrusts\nwith local administrative affairs. A typical group was studied in a\nmission at Masaka. An examination of 664 teeth of twenty-one\nindividuals revealed only three teeth with caries, or 0.4 per cent.West Nile Laborers from the Belgian Congo.The West Nile\nLaborers studied at Masaka represent a very strong and dependable\ngroup. They come from districts north of Lake Albert in Belgian Congo.\nThey are much sought for in industrial enterprises and are often moved\nin groups for a considerable distance.A study of 984 teeth of thirty-one individuals revealed that\nonly three teeth had ever been attacked by tooth decay, or 0.3 per\ncent. Only one individual had dental caries.As one travels down the West Nile and later along the western\nborder of Ethiopia many unique tribes are met. A typical negroid type\nof the upper Nile region is shown in Fig. 42. Members of these tribes\nwear little or no clothing. They have splendid physiques and high\nimmunity to dental caries.FIG. 42. The reward of obeying\nnature's laws of nutrition is illustrated in this west Nile tribe in\nBelgian Congo. Note the breadth of the dental arches and the finely\nproportioned features. Their bodies are as well built as their heads.\nExceedingly few teeth have been attacked by dental caries while on\ntheir native foods.After the confluence of the White Nile and West Nile, the former\ndraining Lake Victoria and the Uganda lakes through Uganda, and the\nlatter, Lakes Kivu, Edwards and Albert and eastern Belgian Congo, the\nvolume of water moving northward is very large. A unique obstruction to\nnavigation has developed due to the fact that the Nile runs underground\nfor a considerable distance. In this district vegetation is rank and\nprolific, including large quantities of water plants which form islands\nthat are often attached temporarily to the shore. The water carries\nlarge quantities of alluvia which furnish an abundance of nutriment to\nthe floating plant life. Accordingly, in many of these floating islands\na large quantity of soil is enmeshed in the plant roots. At some period\nin the past the river became bridged across in upper Sudan near its\nsouthern border. With the progressive addition of new material a large\nnatural bridge has been raised on which trees are now growing, and\nacross which are elephant trails. This and a series of rapids require a\ndetour of over a hundred miles.The elephants are so plentiful in this district that both in\nUganda and Sudan the governments have been required to send in special\nhunters to reduce the herds. In one district in Uganda two hundred were\nsaid to have been slaughtered. They are very destructive to banana\nplantations. They break the banana trees over or pull them up by the\nroots and eat the succulent heart as well as the fruits. In a night a\nherd may destroy an entire plantation. The only people in the districts\nwho are permitted to kill the elephants without license are the\npygmies. They are also the only ones not required to pay a head tax.\nThere are many tribes of them in the great forest area in Belgian Congo\nand Uganda. Their skill with spears is remarkable and they are able to\nkill an elephant while the animal remains unaware of his danger. It\ntakes them one to two days to hamstring an elephant by working\nstealthily from behind, always keeping out of the elephant's sight.\nAlthough an elephant can scent a human for a long distance, these\npygmies can disguise themselves so completely that the elephant is\nunaware of their presence. After disabling him by cutting the tendons\nof both hind legs, they attack him openly and, while one attracts his\nattention, the other slowly but progressively hacks off his trunk. In\nthis manner he bleeds to death. They are particularly fond of elephant\nmeat and a slaughter means a great feast. While we were in one of the\npygmy colonies two of them brought in the tusks of an elephant they had\njust killed. We had the rare opportunity of witnessing the celebration\nin the colony, which included the special reproduction in pantomime of\nthe attack and method of killing the elephant. The pygmy mother of\nthese two men is shown in Fig. 43 (lower half). It will be noticed that\nshe is a full head shorter than Mrs. Price, who is five feet three\ninches tall. This rugged, though small, woman is the mother of five\ngrown men, two of whom are shown in Fig. 43 with the tusks of the\nelephant. Note their homemade spears. As marksmen with bows and arrows\nand as trappers, these pygmies have wonderful skill. Their arrows are\ntipped with iron of their own manufacture and have receptacles for\ncarrying drugs which they extract from plants. These drugs temporarily\nparalyze the animals. For animals which they wish to destroy the arrows\ncarry a poison which rapidly produces death. The home life of the\npygmies in the forest is often filled with danger. Just before our\narrival two babies had been carried off by a leopard. This stealthy\nnight prowler is one of the most difficult animals to combat and\nprobably has been one of the reasons the pygmies build cabins in the\ntrees. Ordinarily their homes are built on the ground in a little\nclearing in the big forest. They consist of low shelters covered with\nbanana leaves and other plants, built over a frame work. The native\nmissionary dispensed our gift of salt which is one of their most prized\ngifts. They put on a dance for us.FIG. 43. The Pygmies of Belgian\nCongo are expert hunters. The two young men in the center above have\nslain single handed the large bull elephant whose tusks they are\nholding. The spears used are shown. They are two of five grown sons of\nthe pygmy mother standing next to Mrs. Price in the lower picture.\nTheir teeth are excellent and their knowledge of foods\nunique.Pygmies, Ituru Forest, Belgian Congo.These people are\nsaid to have originally lived in the trees and they were exceedingly\nshy and difficult to contact. We were taken to several of their\nvillages in the heart of the dense Ituru forest. We found them very\nwell disposed through the confidence that has been established by the\nmission workers. Their shyness, however, together with the difficulty\nof making them understand through two transfers of languages, made an\nexamination of their teeth very difficult.A study of 352 teeth of twelve individuals revealed eight teeth\nhad been attacked by tooth decay, or 2.2 per cent.The native tribes of Africa have depended to a great extent on\nfresh water fish from the numerous lakes and rivers for certain of\ntheir essential food factors. After being dried in the sun these fish\nare carried long distances into the interior. The Nile perch grows\nfrequently to a weight of 150 pounds. The natives of Africa know that\ncertain insects are very rich in special food values at certain\nseasons, also that their eggs are valuable foods. A fly that hatches in\nenormous quantities in Lake Victoria is gathered and used fresh and\ndried for storage. They also use ant eggs and ants.Nyankunde Mission, Iruinu, Belgian Congo.This group is\nmade up of members of the Bahema, Babira, Alur and Balendu tribes. We\nwill consider the representatives of these different tribes\ncollectively since they live largely on a common dietary consisting\nchiefly of cereals. Only the Bahemas of this group have small herds of\ncattle. Some of the others have a few goats. This district is located\nsouthwest of Lake Albert.A study of 6,461 teeth of 217 individuals revealed 390 teeth\nwith dental caries, or 6 per cent. Thirty-eight and seven-tenths per\ncent of the individuals suffered from dental caries.Bogora Mission, Belgian Congo.This mission is located\nwest of Lake Albert and includes members of the Bahema and Balendu\ntribes. While the Bahema tribe originally lived very largely on cattle\nproducts, milk, blood and meat, in this district, the herds were small\nand they were using a considerable quantity of cereals, chiefly corn\nand beans, some sweet potatoes and bananas. These latter were the chief\nfoods of the other tribes, in addition to goats' milk.An examination of 2,196 teeth of seventy-seven individuals\nrevealed 160 teeth with caries, or 7.2 per cent. Fifty-three per cent\nof the individuals had caries.Kasenyi Port, Lake Albert, Belgian Congo.These natives\nwere members of several tribes surrounding this district who were for\nthe most part temporary residents as laborers. The people had been\nliving largely on a cereal diet and now during their temporary\nresidence at the port had had fish.An examination of 1,940 teeth of sixty-three individuals\nrevealed 120 teeth with dental caries, or 6.1 per cent of the teeth.\nFifty and eighttenths per cent of the individuals had dental\ncaries.Wanande Tribe, Belgian Congo.This tribe is located at\nLubero in Belgian Congo. Their diet consists largely of bananas, sweet\npotatoes, cereals and goats' milk.In an examination of 368 teeth of thirteen individuals, there\nwere eight teeth with caries, or 2.2 per cent. Fifteen and four-tenths\nper cent of the individuals were affected.Baitu Tribe, Nyunge, Ruanda, Belgian Protectorate.This\ndistrict lies south of Uganda and east of Belgian Congo proper,\nnorthwest of Tanganyika. It lies just east of Lake Kivu. When we learn\nthat Lake Kivu was only discovered in 1894, even though it is one of\nthe important sources of the Nile waters, we realize the primitiveness\nof the people of this and adjoining districts. This group lives largely\non dairy products from cattle and goats, together with sweet potatoes,\ncereals and bananas.In a study of 364 teeth of thirteen individuals, not a single\ntooth was found to have been attacked by dental caries.Native Hotel Staff at Goina, Belgian Congo.This group\nconsisted of the inside and outside servants of a tourist hotel on Lake\nKivu.An examination of 320 teeth of ten individuals revealed twenty\nteeth with caries, or 6.3 per cent. It is significant that all of these\ncarious teeth were in the mouth of one individual, the cook. The others\nall boarded themselves and lived on native diets. The cook used\nEuropean foods.Where the members of the African tribes had attached themselves\nto coffee plantations aad were provided with the imported foods of\nwhite flour, sugar, polished rice and canned goods, tooth decay became\nrampant. This is typically illustrated in Fig. 44.FIG. 44. Wherever the Africans\nhave aidopted the foods of modern commerce, dental caries was active,\nthus destroying large numbers of the teeth and causing great suffering.\nThe cases shown here are typical of workers on plantations which\nlargely use imported foods.Anglo-Egyptian Sudan has an area approximately one-third that of\nthe United States. It is traversed throughout its length from south to\nnorth by the Nile. There are several tribes living along this great\nwaterway, which are of special interest now owing to their close\nproximity to Ethiopia. There are wonderful hunters and warriors among\nthem. In hunting they use their long-bladed spears almost entirely. The\nshores of the Nile for nearly a thousand miles in this district are\nlined with papyrus and other water plants to a depth of from several\nhundred yards to a few miles. Back of this area the land rises and\nprovides excellent pasturage for the grazing cattle. These tribes,\ntherefore, use milk, blood and meat from cattle and large quantities of\nanimal life from the Nile River. Some of the tribes are very tall,\nparticularly the Neurs. The women are often six feet or over, and the\nmen seven feet, some of them reaching seven and a half feet in height.\nI was particularly interested in their food habits both because of\ntheir high immunity to dental caries which approximated one hundred per\ncent, and because of their physical development. I learned that they\nhave a belief which to them is their religion, namely, that every man\nand woman has a soul which resides in the liver and that a man's\ncharacter and physical growth depend upon how well he feeds that soul\nby eating the livers of animals. The liver is so sacred that it may not\nbe touched by human hands. It is accordingly always handled with their\nspear or saber, or with specially prepared forked sticks. It is eaten\nboth raw and cooked.Many of these tribes, like the Neurs, wear no clothing and\ndecorate their bodies with various designs, some of them representing\nstrings of beads produced by putting foreign substances under the skin\nin definite order. They have maintained a particularly bitter warfare\nagainst the Arab slave dealers who have come across from the Red Sea\ncoast to carry off the women and children. In isolated districts even\nto this day they are suspicious of foreigners. We were told that in one\ndistrict adjoining Ethiopia all light skinned people are in danger and\ncannot safely enter that territory without a military escort.Terraizeka, Upper Nile, Sudan.These people are tall and\nlive largely on fish and other animal life. This part of Sudan consists\nof many districts of great marshland called the sudd. It is covered\nwith rank papyrus to the height of fifteen to thirty feet. This jungle\nof rank marsh growth swarms with a wide variety of animal life, large\nand small.An examination of 548 teeth of eighteen individuals revealed\nthat not a single tooth had been attacked by dental caries, or 100 per\ncent immunity.Neurs, Malakal, Sudan.The Neurs at Malakal on the Nile\nRiver are a unique tribe because of their remarkable stature. Many of\nthe women are six feet tall and the men range from six feet to seven\nand a half feet in height. Their food consists very largely of animal\nlife of the Nile, dairy products, milk and blood from the herds.A study of 1,268 teeth of thirty-nine individuals revealed only\nsix teeth with dental caries, or 0.5 per cent. Only three individuals\nhad caries, or 7.7 per cent.Dinkas, Jebelein, Sudan.This tribe lives on the Nile.\nIts members are not as tall as the Neurs. They are physically better\nproportioned and have greater strength. They use fish from the Nile and\ncereals for their diet. They decorate their bodies profusely with\nscars.An examination of 592 teeth of twenty-two individuals revealed\nonly one tooth with caries, or 0.2 per cent.Arab Schools at Khartoum and Omdurman, Sudan.The Arabs\nare the chief occupants of the territory of Northern Sudan. Omdurman on\nthe west bank of the White Nile opposite Khartoum is the largest purely\nArab city in the world. It has been but slightly influenced by modern\ncivilization. Khartoum, on the contrary, just across the river from\nOmdurman and the capital of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, has districts which\nare typically modern. These include the government offices and\nadministration organization. The Arab section of Khartoum has been\ndefinitely influenced by contact with the Europeans. This makes\npossible a comparative study of similar groups in the two\ncities-modernized Khartoum and primitive Omdurman.A study of 1,284 teeth of fifty-two individuals in an Arab\nschool at Khartoum revealed that 59 teeth or 4.7 per cent had been\nattacked by dental caries, or 44.2 per cent of the individuals\nstudied.In Omdurman a study of 744 teeth in thirty-one individuals,\nrevealed only nine teeth that had been attacked by tooth decay, or 1.2\nper cent. In this group only two or 6.4 per cent of the individuals had\ndental caries.The groups examined were selected with the assistance of the\ngovernment officials and consisted of the higher grade pupils in two\nadvanced native schools, one in Khartoum and one in Omdurman.It is of interest that of the two boys in the Arab school at\nOmdurman with dental caries one was the son of a rich merchant and used\nliberally sweets and European foods.Native Hospital, Khartoum, Sudan.The individuals studied\nin this institution were from quite remote areas distributed through\nSudan. Some had traveled many days on camels to obtain the help that\nthe hospital provided.A study of 288 teeth of ten individuals revealed that thirteen\nhad been attacked by tooth decay, or 4.5 per cent.Ikhlas School, Cairo, Egypt.This is a native school in\nwhich the individuals are comparable in many respects to those in the\nnative schools at Khartoum and Omdurman. Their nutrition is highly\nmodernized by living in a modern city.A study of 2,092 teeth of eighty-five individuals revealed that\n353 teeth or 12.1 per cent had been attacked by tooth decay.\nSeventy-five per cent of the individuals of this group had dental\ncaries.The total number of teeth examined in the preceding groups was\n28,438. Of this number, 1,346 were found with dental caries or 4.7 per\ncent. This represents a total of 1,002 individuals examined, of whom\n300 had one or more carious teeth, or had lost teeth by caries, making\n29.9 per cent of the individuals with dental caries. Of this total\nnumber of individuals studied in twenty-seven groups, there were\nseveral groups with practically complete immunity to dental caries,\nwhile other groups had relatively high incidence of that disease.Facial and Dental Arch Deformities.The purpose of these\nstudies has included the obtaining of data which will throw light also\non the etiology of deformities of the dental arches and face, including\nirregularity of position of the teeth.A marked variation of the incidence of irregularities was found\nin the different tribes. This variation could be directly associated\nwith the nutrition rather than with the tribal pattern. The lowest\npercentage of irregularity occurred in the tribes living very largely\non dairy products and marine life. For example, among the Masai living\non milk, blood and meat, only 3.4 per cent had irregularities. Among\nthe Kikuyu and Wakamba, 18.2 and 18.9 per cent respectively had\nirregularities. These peap!e were largely agriculturists living\nprimarily on vegetable foods. In the native Arab school at Omdurman,\namong the pupils living almost entirely according to the native customs\nof selection and preparation of foods, 6.4 per cent had irregularities,\nwhile in the native school at modernized Khartoum 17 per cent had\nirregularities. In the Ikhlas school at Cairo, under modern influence,\n16.5 per cent had irregularities. In the native hospital at Khartoum,\n70 per cent had irregularities. In the Pygmy group 33.3 per cent had\nirregularities, and among the grain eaters of the west Nile, 25.5 per\ncent had irregularities. The Jeannes School had 46.1 per cent and the\nOgada mission 30 per cent.While the primitive racial stocks of Africa developed normal\nfacial and dental arch forms when on their native foods, several\ncharacteristic types of deformity frequently developed in the children\nof the modernized groups. One of the simplest forms, and one which\ncorresponds with a very common deformity pattern in the United States,\ninvolves the dropping inward of the laterals with narrowing of the\nupper arch making the incisors appear abnormally prominent and crowding\nthe cuspids outside the line of the arch. Typical illustrations of this\nare shown in Fig. 45. Where the nutritional deficiency is very severe,\nas at Mombasa on the coast, more severe changes in facial form are\nfound.FIG. 45. In the new\ngenerations, born after the parents had adopted typical modernized\ndiets of Europeans, there was a marked change in the facial and dental\narch forms of the adolescent children. Note the narrowing of the\nnostrils and dental arches and the crowding of the teeth in these four\ntypical young men.Among the deformity patterns a lack of development forward of\nthe middle third of the face or of the lower third of the face often\nappeared in the more highly modernized groups. An illustration of the\nformer is seen in Fig. 46 (upper left), and of the latter in Fig. 46\n(lower left and right). In the girl at the upper left, the upper arch\ntends to go inside the lower arch all around. This girl is of the first\ngeneration, in a mission in Nairobi, following the adoption of the\nmodernized foods by the parents.FIG. 46. Disturbed nature may\npresent a variety nf deformity patterns. In the upper left the upper\narch is much too small for the lower and nearly goes inside it. The\nupper right is narrowed with crowding of the teeth. Both lower cases\ndemonstrate an underdevelopment of the mandible of the lower\njaw.A more extreme and severe type of facial change involves an\nabnormal narrowing with marked distortion of both upper and lower\narches. This is shown typically in Fig. 47.FIG. 47. As in our\ncivilization, even the first generation, after the adoption of\nmodernized foods may show gross deformities. Note the extreme\nprotrusion of the upper teeth with shortening of the lower jaw in the\nupper pictures and the marked narrowing with lengthening of the face in\nthe lower views. The injury is not limited to the visible\nstructures.These extreme deformities often produce facial expressions that\nare suggestive of the faces of some of the monkeys. This is illustrated\nby the three boys shown with the monkey in Fig. 48.FIG. 48. A very frequent injury\napearing in the offspring after the adoption of less efficient foods\noften involves a marked depression of the middle third of the face as\nillustrated in the three boys in this view. Note the comparison with\nthe chimpanzee face.The Arabs in several districts use camels' milk extensively. It\nis nutritious, and in much of the desert country constitutes the\nmainstay of the nomads for months at a time. The primitive Arabs\nstudied had fine dental arches with very little deformity. Even the\nhorses ridden by the Arab chiefs in moving their camel herds across the\ndesert are often dependent, sometimes for as long as three months, upon\nthe milk of the camels for their nutrition. Typical Arab faces and a\ncamel caravan at rest are shown in Fig. 49. The primitive Arab girls\nhave splendidly developed faces and fine dental arches. Their natural\nbeauty, however, is rapidly lost with modernization, as illustrated in\nFig. 50.FIG. 49. In the hot desert\ncountries of Asia and Africa camel's milk is an important item of human\nnutrition. The teeth of the Arahs, as illustrated helow, are excellent.\nLarge areas could not maintain human life without the camel and its\nmilk.FIG. 50. Both girls and boys in\nthe modernized colonies in Cairo showed typical deformity patterns in\nfaces and dental arches. The health of these groups is not comparable\nto that of those living on the native dietaries. Reproductive\nefficiency in these generations is greatly reduced.Dr. Hrdlicka has called attention to the occasional development\nin several racial stocks of individuals who travel on all fours instead\nof upright. I saw several individuals of this type in Africa scooting\naround about as rapidly as the dogs. They were, accordingly, difficult\nto photograph. Two are shown in Fig. 51.FIG. 51. These two native\nAfrican children scooted around on all fours so swiftly that it was\ndifficult to take their pictures. We did not see them stand up. They\nbehaved very much like tame chimpanzees.While slavery of the old form no longer exists in the so-called\ncivilized countries, in its new form it is a most tragic reality for\nmany of the people. Taxes and the new order of living make many\ndemands. For many of these primitive tribes a new suit of clothes could\nformerly be had every day with no more trouble than cutting a new\nbanana leaf. With the new order they are requested to cover their\nbodies with clothing. Cloth of all kinds including the poorest cotton\nhas to be imported. They must pay an excessive charge due to the long\ntransportation cost for the imported goods, a charge which often\nexceeds the original cost in the European or American markets by\nseveral fold. In order to pay their head tax they are frequently\nrequired to carry such products as can be used by the government\nofficials, chiefly foods, over long distances and for part of each\nyear. These foods are often those which not only the adults, but\nparticularly the growing children sorely need for providing body growth\nand repair. This naturally has produced a current of acute unrest and a\nchafing under the foreign domination.As we encircled Ethiopia we found the natives not only aware of\nwhat was going on in that border country, but deeply concerned\nregarding the outcome. From their temper and sympathetic attitude for\nthe oppressed Ethiopians, it would not be surprising if sympathizers\npass over the border into that country to support their crushed\nneighbors. The problem is accordingly very much larger than the\ninterest of some particular foreign power. It deals directly with the\nfuture course of events and the attitude of the African natives in\ngeneral toward foreign domination. The native African is not only\nchafing under the taxation by foreign overlords, but is conscious that\nhis race becomes blighted when met by our modern civilization. I found\nthem well aware of the fact that those of their tribes who had adopted\nEuropean methods of living and foods not only developed rampant tooth\ndecay, but other degenerative processes.In one of the most efficiently organized mission schools that we\nfound in Africa, the principal asked me to help them solve a serious\nproblem. He said there was no single question asked them so often by\nthe native boys in their school as why it is that those families that\nhave grown up in the mission or government schools were physically not\nso strong as those families who had never been in contact with the\nmission or government schools. These young men were thinking. I was\neven asked several times by them whether or not I thought that the\nnative Africans must go the way of the Red Indians of America.The happiness of the people in their homes and community life is\neverywhere very striking. A mining prospector who had spent two decades\nstudying the mineral deposits of Uganda was quoted to me as stating\nthat if he could have the heaven of his choice in which to spend all\neternity it would be to live in Uganda as the natives of Uganda had\nlived before modern civilization came to it.While inter-tribal warfare has largely ceased, a new scourge is\nupon them, namely the scourge which comes with modern civilization. As\nin the primitive racial stocks previously studied and reported, we\nfound that modernizing forces were often associated with a very marked\nincrease of the death rate over the birth rate. In some districts in\nAfrica a marked degeneration is taking place. Geoffrey Gorer in his\nbook, \"Africa Dances,\"(1)which was written\nafter making studies in West Africa, discusses this problem at\nlength.He quotes figures given by Marcel Sauvage(2)in his article on French Equatorial Africa: \"'In 1911\nFrench Equatorial Africa had twenty million negro inhabitants; in 1921\nthere were seven and a half million; in 1931 there were two and a half\nmillion.'\"He states regarding the quotation: \"These figures were given in a\nresponsible French conservative paper and have not been denied.\" Major\nBrowne, a high official of the British Government Administrative\nDepartment of Kenya, with long experience, states in the closing\nparagraph of his book entitled, \"The Vanishing Tribes of Kenya,\"(3)the following:It must also be remembered that the \"blessings\nof civilization\" are not in practice by any means as obvious as some\nsimple-minded folk would like to believe. It can be said with fair\naccuracy that among the tribes with which we have been dealing there\nis, in their uncontaminated society, no pauperism, no paid\nprostitution, very little serious drunkenness, and on the whole\nastonishingly little crime; while practically everyone has enough to\neat, sufficient clothing, and an adequate dwelling, according to the\nprimitive native standard. Of what civilized community can as much be\nsaid?Civilizations have been rising and\nfalling not only through all the period of recorded history, but long\nbefore as evidenced by archeological findings. If we think of Nature's\ncalendar as one in which centuries are days and civilizations are\nyears, the part current events are playing in the history of a great\ncontinent like Africa may be mere incidents.This much we do know that throughout the world some remnants of\nseveral primitive racial stocks have persisted to this day even in very\nexacting environments and only by such could they have been\nprotected.In my studies of these several racial stocks I find that it is\nnot accident but accumulated wisdom regarding foods that lies behind\ntheir physical excellence and freedom from our modern degenerative\nprocesses, and, further, that on various sides of our world the\nprimitive people know many of the things that are essential for\nlife-things that our modern civilizations apparently do not know. These\nare the fundamental truths of life that have put them in harmony with\nNature through obeying her nutritional laws. Whence this wisdom? Was\nthere in the distant past a world civilization that was better attuned\nto Nature's laws and have these remnants retained that knowledge? If\nthis is not the explanation, it must be that these various primitive\nracial stocks have been able through a superior skill in interpreting\ncause and effect, to determine for themselves what foods in their\nenvironment are best for producing human bodies with a maximum of\nphysical fitness and resistance to degeneration.Primitive native races of eastern and central Africa have in\ntheir native state a very high immunity to dental caries, ranging from\n0 to less than 1 per cent of the teeth affected for many of the tribes.\nWhere modernized, however, the incidence increased to 12.1 per\ncent.In the matter of facial deformity thirteen tribes out of\ntwenty-seven studied presented so high a standard of excellence that\nnot a single individual in the group was found with deformed dental\narches.Their nutrition varied according to their location, but always\nprovided an adequate quantity of body-building and repairing material,\neven though much effort was required to obtain some of the essential\nfood factors. Many tribes practiced feeding girls special foods for an\nextended period before marriage. Spacing of children was provided by a\nsystem of plural wives.REFERENCESGORER, G. Africa Dances. N. Y., Knopf, 1935.SAUVAGE, M. Les secrets de l'Afrique Noire.Intransigeant,July-Aug., 1934.BROWNE, G. The Vanishing Tribes of Kenya. London, Seeley Service,\n1925.TABLE OF CONTENTSChapter 10ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED AUSTRALIAN\nABORIGINESOUR problem of throwing light upon the cause\nof the physical breakdown of our modern civilization, with special\nconsideration of tooth decay and facial deformity, requires a critical\nexamination of individuals living in as wide a range of physical\nconditions as may be possible. This requires that the Aborigines of\nAustralia be included in this examination of human reactions to\nphysical environments. These were studied in 1936.In selecting the individuals in the various groups special\neffort was made to include children between the ages of ten and sixteen\nyears in order to have an opportunity to observe and record the\ncondition of the dental arches after the permanent teeth had erupted.\nThis was necessary because the deciduous dentition or first set of\nteeth may be in normal position in the arches with a correct\nrelationship between the arches, and the permanent dentition show\nmarked irregularity. The shape of the dental arches of the infant at\nbirth and the teeth that are to take their place in the arches have\nconsiderable of their calcification at birth. The development of the\nadult face, however, does not occur until the permanent teeth have\nerupted. The general shape or pattern is largely influenced by the\nposition and direction of the eruption of the permanent teeth. These\nstudies, accordingly, have included a careful, detailed record of the\nshape of the dental arch of each individual.The Australian Aborigines constitute one of the most unique\nprimitive races that have come out of the past into our modern times\nand they are probably the oldest living race. We are particularly\nconcerned with those qualities that have made possible their survival\nand cultural development.The Aborigines are of special interest because they have come\nout of a very distant past and are associated with animal life which is\nunique in being characterized as a living museum preserved from the\ndawn of animal life on the earth. Many of the animal species that are\nabundant in Australia are found only in fossil form on other\ncontinents. The evidence indicates that they crossed on a land bridge\nwhich connected Australia with Asia. After the bridge was submerged the\nanimals persisted in that protected island continent which never has\nknown any of the animal species of later development. Among these\nanimals the marsupials play an important role and constitute a large\nvariety. The American continent has only one or two of the many forms\nfound in Australia. These are the opossum of the marsupial family and\nthe sloth. One of the most curious animals living on the earth today,\nor that has left its remains in the petrified skeletons of early\nperiods of the earth's history, is the duckbill platypus. It has the\nunique distinction of having the characteristics of several animal\nspecies. It lays eggs like a bird and hatches them with the heat of its\nbody in its pouch. It has webbed, five-toed feet, like the water birds,\na bill like a duck and hair and tail like a beaver. The typical\nmarsupial pouch for carrying its young, is another characteristic of\nthis strange animal. Like other mammals it provides milk for its young.\nIts milk is similar in chemical constituents to that of other mammals.\nMost rudimentary in form are the mammary glands of the platypus. The\nyoung, when hatched in the pouch, nuzzle the lining membrane of the\npouch and the milk exudes through minute openings. There is no nipple.\nThe animal lives chiefly in the water. Its home is built above the\nwater level on the bank, but the entrance to it is underneath the\nwater. They are exceedingly playful creatures, apparently more at home\nin the water than on land. They live on both animal life and plant food\nfound under the water. They seem to be related to an early era of\ndifferentiation of animal species.The Aborigines are credited with having the most primitive type\nof skeletal development of any race living today. The eyes are very\ndeep set, the brows very prominent giving them an expression that\nidentifies them as a distinct racial type. See Fig. 52. Professor\nWeidenreich has shown that they resemble in this regard the recently\ndiscovered ancient Peking man. While they are still in the Stone Age\nstage in their arts and crafts, they have developed further in some\nrespects than has any other ancient race. Their skill in tracking and\noutwitting the fleet and very cunning animal life of their land is so\nremarkable that they have been accredited with a sixth sense. They have\nbeen able to build good bodies and maintain them in excellent condition\nin a country in which the plant life, and consequently the lower animal\nlife can be maintained at only a very low level because of the absence\nof rain. Over half of Australia has less than ten inches of rain a\nyear. It is significant that the natives have maintained a vigorous\nexistence in districts in which the white population which expelled\nthem is unable to continue to live. Among the white race there, the\ndeath rate approaches or exceeds the birth rate.FIG. 52. The Aborigines of\nAustralia are recognized to be the oldest living race of mankind. Note\nthe prominent eyebrows and deep set eyes. The man at the upper right is\nholding his spears and wamara, or spear thrower. They are very fond of\ndecorations on their bodies. Little baldness was seen even in the very\nold.They have developed a device for throwing spears, which makes\nthem more deadly than any in the world. I witnessed a group of the\npresent-day natives throwing their spears at a target which consisted\nof a banana stalk much smaller than a man's body. They threw the spears\nfrom a distance which I estimated to be seventy-five yards. About\nthirty spears were thrown and several pierced the banana stalk and the\nothers were stuck in the ground close around it. This was accomplished\nby means of a wamara or throwing stick approximately as long as the\narm, with a strong hand grip at one end and a device on the other end\nfor engaging in a depression in the butt of the spear. This was thrown\nby poising the spear about the level of the shoulder, the spear\nsupported by the fingers of the hand which swung the throwing stick.\nThe latter extended back over the shoulder. The impact of their spears\nhas often been demonstrated to be sufficient to completely penetrate a\nman's body. Their method of tempering wood for the points of the spears\nwas such that the spearheads offered great resistance. A throwing stick\nis shown in Fig. 52 (upper right).These natives decorate their bodies with paints for dances and\nsports. They know the habits of all of the animals and insects so well\nthat they are able to reproduce the calls of the animals and thus decoy\nthem into traps. Some of the water birds maintain sentinels at lookout\npoints to guard those in the water. The Aborigines are able to decoy\nthese birds by most ingenious methods. They travel with their bodies\ndisguised by grass and shrubbery and enter the water with a headgear\nmade from feathers of one of the birds. Once in the water, they then\nmaneuver in a manner similar to that of the birds and go among the\nflock of wild ducks or swans. Working entirely under water, they draw\nthe birds under one by one and take load after load to shore without\nraising the suspicion of the flock. When working among the kangaroos\nthey are so skilled in preparing movable blinds that they can kill many\nin a grazing wild pack without alarming the rest, always striking when\nthe animal is grazing. Their skill at fishing probably exceeds that of\nany other race. They are so highly trained in the knowledge of the\nhabits of the fish and the type of movement that the fish transmits to\nthe water and to the reeds in the water, that one of their important\ncontests between tribes is to see how many fish can be struck in\nsuccession with a spear, the fish never being seen, their only\ninformation as to its whereabouts being the change in the surface of\nthe water and movement of grasses that are growing in the water as the\nfish moves. The fish are started by the umpire's striking the water.\nThe experts bring up a fish six times out of eight. These fishing\ncontests are held along the banks of lakes and rivers where the water\nis deep enough for some of the reeds and grasses to come to the\nsurface. The contestants travel in canoes.The native canoe is cut in one piece from the side of a tree,\nthe cutting being done with stone axes. The canoe offers an exceedingly\ntreacherous platform from which a standing man must throw his spear.\nFor some of the contests the canoe carries a paddler, but in the most\nexacting contests the spear man must manage his own flat-bottomed\ncanoe.The skill of the Aborigines in tracking is so phenomenal that\npractically every large modern town or city in Australia has one or\nmore of these men on its police staff today to track criminals. For\nweeks, they carry the detailed information about the characteristics of\nthe prisoner's foot across the desert, and when they come across the\nman s foot print they recognize it among all others in the same path.\nEvery leaf that is turned over or grain of sand on bare rocks has\nmeaning for them.Their social organization is such that almost every person who\nhad been in intimate contact with them, testified that they had never\nknown any of the Aborigines to be guilty of the theft of anything. Even\nwhere partly modernized, as they are in the large government\nreservations they are trustworthy. A nurse in an emergency hospital\ntold me that she continually left her money, jewelry and other objects\nof personal property freely exposed and available where many of the\nhundreds of primitives passing could pick them up, and that she had\nnever known them to take anything. The other nurses had had the same\nexperience.Every boy and girl among these Aborigines must pass many\nexaminations. Their early schooling includes the tracking of small\nanimals and insects. The small boys begin throwing spears almost as\nsoon as they can stand up straight. No young man can even witness a\nmeeting of the council, let alone become a member of it, until he has\npassed three supreme tests of manhood. First, he is tested for his\nability to withstand hunger without complaint. The test for this is to\ngo on a march for two or three days over the hot desert and assist in\npreparing the meals of roast kangaroo and other choice foods and not\npartake of any himself. He must not complain. If he becomes too weak,\nhe is given a small portion. There are tests for fear in which he is\nplaced under the most trying ordeals without knowing that it is part of\nhis examination, and he must demonstrate that he will accept death\nrather than flee. No member of their society would be allowed to\ncontinue to live with the tribe if he had defied the ideals of the\ngroup. Immorality is cause for immediate death.The growing boys among the Aborigines are taught deference and\nesteem for their elders in many impressive ways. A boy may not kill or\ncapture a slow moving animal. That is left for the older men, whom he\nmust call. He must limit his hunting primarily to the fast fleeing and\ncanny kangaroos and wallabies, whom even a man on horseback cannot\noutdistance. Racketeers and such unsocial beings could not exist in\nthis type of civilization.Marriages are arranged according to very distinct tribal\npatterns and every girl is provided with a husband at a time decided by\nthe council. Their code of ethics is built around the conception of a\npowerful Supreme Force that is related to the sun. They believe that\nthere is an after-existence in which the myriads of stars represent the\nspirits of the Aborigines that lived before. The boys and girls are\ntaught the names of the great characters that make up the different\nconstellations. These were individuals who had conquered all of the\ntemptations of life and had lived so completely in the interest of\nothers that they had fulfilled the great motivating principle of their\nreligion, which is that life consists in serving others as one would\nwish to be served. The seven stars of Pleiades were seven beautiful\nmaidens that had surpassed most other girls in their devotion and\nservice in the interest of their tribe. It is most remarkable how\nclosely this concept is related to the classical myth regarding the\nseven daughters of Atlas and the nymph, Pleione.A part of a young men's examination to determine his ability to\nwithstand pain and his power of self-control consists in performing an\noperation at the time of his graduation. This operation is at the same\ntime calculated to provide him with his badge of attainment. It\nconsists of the boy's lying on his back and allowing the appointed\noperator to knock out one of his front upper teeth. This is done by\nputting a peg against the tooth and hitting it a series of sharp blows\nwith a stone. He must endure this without flinching. We saw scores that\ncarried this diploma. Prior to this, other very severe tests of\nphysical endurance had been successfully completed.The marvelous vision of these primitive people is illustrated by\nthe fact that they can see many stars that our race cannot see. In this\nconnection it is authoritatively recorded regarding the Maori of New\nZealand that they can see the satellites of Jupiter which are only\nvisible to the white man's eye with the aid of telescopes. These people\nprove that they can see the satellites by telling the man at the\ntelescope when the eclipse of one of the stars occurs. It is said of\nthese primitive Aborigines of Australia that they can see animals\nmoving at a distance of a mile which ordinary white people can not see\nat all.While these evidences of superior physical development command\nour most profound admiration, their ability to build superb bodies and\nmaintain them in excellent condition in so difficult an environment\ncommands our genuine respect. It is a supreme test of human efficiency.\nIt is doubtful if many places in the world can demonstrate so great a\ncontrast in physical development and perfection of body as that which\nexists between the primitive Aborigines of Australia who have been the\nsole arbiters of their fate, and those Aborigines who have been under\nthe influence of the white man. The white man has deprived them of\ntheir original habitats and is now feeding them in reservations while\nusing them as laborers in modern industrial pursuits. This contrast\nbetween the primitive Aborigines as they still exist in isolated\ncommunities in Australia and the modern members of the clans is not,\nhowever, much greater than that between these excellent primitives and\nthe whites, near whom they are living.In my comparative study of primitive races in different parts of\nthe world, of modernized members of their groups and of whites who have\ndisplaced them, as well as in my study of our typical modern social\norganization, I have seldom, if ever, found whites suffering so\ntragically from evidence of physical degeneration, as expressed in\ntooth decay and change in facial form, as are the whites of eastern\nAustralia. This has occurred on the very best of the land that these\nprimitives formerly occupied and becomes at once a monument to the\nwisdom of the primitive Aborigines and a signboard of warning to the\nmodern civilization that has supplanted them. Their superb physical\nexcellence is demonstrated in every isolated group in the primitive\nstocks with which we came in contact. For tribes that have lived along\nthe coast and had access to the sea foods, their stature was large and\nwell formed.When living in the Bush they are largely without clothing. Where\nthey are congregated in the reservations they are required to wear\nclothing. It is important to note in these people the splendid\nproportions of the faces, all of which are broad, with the dental\narches wide and well contoured. This is Nature's normal form for all\nhumans and is shown in Figs. 53 and 54 (upper right). The person in\nFig. 53 (upper left) is a woman.FIG. 53. No other primitive\nrace seems to deserve so much credit for skill in obeying nature's laws\nas these primitive Aborigines because of the perpetual drought hazards\nof much of the land they live in. Half of Australia has less than ten\ninches of rain per year. Note the magnificent dental arches and\nbeautiful teeth of these primitives. Tooth decay was almost unknown in\nmany districts.FIG. 54. Wherever the primitive\nAborigines have been placed in reservations and fed on the white man's\nfoods of commerce dental caries has become rampant. This destroys their\nbeauty, prevents mastication, and provides infection for seriously\ninjuring their bodies. Note the contrast between the primitive woman in\nthe upper right and the three modernized women.Various factors in the changed environment were studied\ncritically. Samples of foods were gathered for chemical analysis; and\nthe changes in the modern diet from that which was characteristic of\nthe primitives were studied. When the teeth of the primitives and the\nteeth found in the skulls that had been assembled in the museums were\nexamined, it was found that dental caries or tooth decay was\nexceedingly rare among the isolated groups. Those individuals, however,\nwho had adopted the foods of the white man suffered extremely from\ntooth decay as did the whites. Where they had no opportunity to get\nnative food to combine with the white man's food their condition was\ndesperate and extreme. This is readily disclosed in Fig. 54. Note\ncontrast with upper right. It is quite impossible to imagine the\nsuffering that these people were compelled to endure due to abscessing\nteeth resulting from rampant tooth decay. As we had found in some of\nthe modernized islands of the Pacific, we discovered that here, too,\ndiscouragement and a longing for death had taken the place of a joy in\nliving in many. Few souls in the world have experienced this\ndiscouragement and this longing to a greater degree.One of the most important phases of our special quest was to get\ninformation that would throw light on the degeneration of the facial\npattern that occurs so often in our modern civilization. This has its\nexpression in the narrowing and lengthening of the face and the\ndevelopment of crooked teeth. It is most remarkable and should be one\nof the most challenging facts that can come to our modern civilization\nthat such primitive races as the Aborigines of Australia, have\nreproduced for generation after generation through many centuries-no\none knows for how many thousands of years-without the development of a\nconspicuous number of irregularities of the dental arches. Yet, in the\nnext generation after these people adopt the foods of the white man, a\nlarge percentage of the children developed irregularities of the dental\narches with conspicuous facial deformities. The deformity patterns are\nsimilar to those seen in white civilizations. Typical illustrations of\nthis will be seen in Figs. 55 and 56. Severe deformities of the face\nwere frequently seen in the modernized groups, as evidenced in Fig.\n57.FIG. 55. It is remarkable that\nregardless of race or color the new generations born after the adoption\nby primitives of deficient foods develop in general the same facial and\ndental arch deformities and skeletal defects. Note the characteristic\nnarrowing of the dental arches and crowding of the teeth of this\nmodernized generation of Aborigines and their similarity to the facial\npatterns of modern whites.FIG. 56. The disturbance in\nfacial growth is often so serious as to make normal breathing through\nthe nose very difficult. This is primarily due to faulty development of\nthe maxillary bones.FIG. 57. Deformity patterns\nproduced in the modernized Aborigines of Australia by white men's food.\nNote the undershot mandible, upper left, the pinched nostrils and\nfacial deformity of all four.The data obtained from a study of the native Australians who are\nlocated in a reservation near Sydney, at LeParouse, revealed that among\nthe Aborigines 47.5 per cent of the teeth had been attacked by dental\ncaries, and 40 per cent of the individuals had abnormal dental arches.\nFor the women of this group, 81.3 per cent of all the teeth had been\nattacked by dental caries, and for the men, 60.4 per cent, and for the\nchildren, 16.5 per cent. In this group 100 per cent of the individuals\nwere affected by dental caries.Palm Island is a government reservation situated in the ocean\nabout fifty miles from the mainland, off the east coast of Australia,\nabout two-thirds of the way up the coast. It was reached by a\ngovernment launch. Included in the population of this reservation are a\nlarge number of adults who have been moved from various districts on\nthe mainland of Central and Eastern Australia and many children who\nwere born either before or after their parents were moved to this\nreservation. The food available on the Island is almost entirely that\nprovided by the government. Of ninety-eight individuals examined and\nmeasured, 53.1 per cent of them had dental caries. For the group as a\nwhole, 8.9 per cent of all of the teeth were affected; for the women,\n21.2 per cent; for the men, 14.2 per cent; and for the children, 5.8\nper cent. Fifty per cent of the children had deformed dental arches,\nwhich occurred in only 11 per cent of the adults.Cape Bedford is situated about three-fourths of the way up the\neast coast and is so isolated that it was necessary for us to use a\nspecial aeroplane to reach it. Landing was made on the beach. This\ngroup of people is under the management of a German Lutheran\nmissionary. They are dependent almost entirely on the food provided by\nthe mission and the government. The official in charge had spent fifty\nyears in devoted service to these native people. We found him\nexceedingly sad because of the very rapid breakdown that was in\nprogress among the natives in his care. The dental caries for the group\nof eighty-three individuals studied was 12.4 per cent of their 2,176\nteeth examined. For the women, this amounted to 37.2 per cent of the\nteeth; for the men, 8.4 per cent; and for the children, 6.1 per cent.\nOf the eighty-three individuals, 48.1 per cent had been affected by\ndental caries. Many of the adults in this group had been born on\nplantations under the influence of the modern nutrition, and many of\nthe children had been born in the mission. For the adults, 46 per cent\nhad abnormally formed dental arches, and for the children, 41.6 per\ncent. We were advised that deaths occurred very frequently from\ntuberculosis. This reservation does not provide the natives with\nnatural hunting grounds capable of providing the people with animal\nlife for food. The coast for some distance inland is a series of sand\ndunes which are slowly being transferred over the vegetation by wind,\ncompletely smothering it. While the coast is well supplied with a\nvariety of deep-water fish the natives have practically no equipment\nfor obtaining them, a condition which restricts them very largely to\nthe use of the imported foods supplied by the officials.Our next stop, using the special aeroplane, was at Lockhart\nRiver, which is about four-fifths of the way up the east coast of\nAustralia. Here again we were able to land on the beach near a large\ngroup of primitive Aborigines. The isolation here is so nearly complete\nthat they are dependent upon the sea and the land for their foods. This\npart of Australia, namely, the York Peninsula, is still so primitive\nthat there has been very little encroachment by the white population.\nIt will be remembered that in this area there are no roads, the country\nbeing a primitive wilderness. Of fifty-eight individuals examined,\ntheir 1,784 teeth revealed that only 4.3 per cent had been attacked by\ndental caries. For the women, this amounted to 3.4 per cent; for the\nmen, 6.1 per cent; and for the children, 3.2 per cent. Some of these\nmen had at some time worked on cattle ranches for the white men. Of the\nchildren, only 6.3 per cent had abnormal dental arches, and of the\nadults, 8.7 per cent. In this group, therefore, 91.4 per cent of all\nages had reproduced the typical racial pattern as compared with 56 per\ncent of the group at Cape Bedford, 62 per cent of the group at Palm\nIsland, and 60 per cent at LeParouse. At Lockhart River, 32.7 per cent\nof the individuals had dental caries.A reservation called Cowall Creek on the west side of York\nPeninsula situated on the Gulf of Carpenteria, was reached by flying\nour special plane to Horn Island in the Torres Strait north of\nAustralia and proceeding from there by boat to Thursday Island, and on,\nby boat, to Cowall Creek. In this reservation thirty-five individuals\nwere studied and found to be in a very pathetic condition. We were told\nthat deaths occurred frequently. Of the 976 teeth examined, 24.6 per\ncent had been attacked by tooth decay. For the women, this amounted to\n60.7 per cent; for the men, 30.4 per cent; and for the children, 8.9\nper cent. Forty-nine and six-tenths per cent of the individuals studied\nhad abnormal dental arches. Of the children 66.6 per cent had deformed\ndental arches, and 9 per cent of the adults. Many of these adults had\nbeen raised in the bush. Of the individuals studied, 68.6 per cent had\nhad dental caries. One can scarcely visualize, without observing it,\nthe distress of a group of primitive people situated as these people\nare, compelled to live in a very restricted area, forced to live on\nfood provided by the government, while they are conscious that if they\ncould return to their normal habits of life they would regain their\nhealth and again enjoy life. Many individuals were seen with abscessing\nteeth. One girl with a fistula exuding pus on the outside of her face\nis shown in Fig. 58 (upper right). In their native life where they\ncould get the foods that keep them well and preserve their teeth, they\nhad no need for dentists. Now they have need, but have no dentists. It\nis easy to chide and blame the officials who provide them with the\nmodernized foods under which they are breaking, but it must be\nremembered that practically all modern civilizations are more or less\nin the same plight themselves.FIG. 58. Aborigines in\nAustralia living on a reservation. The boy at the upper left has\nsuppurating tubercular axillary glands. The girl at the upper right has\npus running to the outside of her face from an abscessed tooth. The boy\nwhose legs are shown at the lower left has a badly deformed body from\nmalnutrition. The girl at the lower right has tubercular glands of the\nneck.An opportunity was provided for examining a group of the native\nAborigines of Australia who made up the crew of eighteen for a\npearl-fishing boat. Of this group, 5.7 per cent of their 554 teeth had\nbeen attacked by tooth decay. These individuals could be readily\ndivided into two groups; namely, those who had been raised in the Bush\nand those who had been raised in missions. For the thirteen raised in\nthe Bush, not a single tooth of their 364 teeth had ever been attacked\nby tooth decay and not a single individual had deformed dental arches.\nIn contrast with this, of the five raised in the mission, 19.3 per cent\nof their 140 teeth had been attacked by tooth decay and 40 per cent of\nthese individuals had abnormal dental arches.The cook on the government boat was an aboriginal Australian\nfrom Northern Australia. He had been trained on a military craft as a\ndietitian. Nearly all his teeth were lost. It is of interest that while\nthe native Aborigines had relatively perfect teeth, this man who was a\ntrained dietitian for the whites had lost nearly all his teeth from\ntooth decay and pyorrhea.In the group of Aborigines so far reported, there were many who\nhad come from the interior districts of Australia and many who had\nalways lived near the coast. These two types of districts provided\nquite different types of foods. Those near the coast were able to\nobtain animal life from the sea, including fish, dugong or sea cow, a\ngreat variety of shell fish, and some sea plants. Those from the\ninterior districts could not obtain animal life of the sea, but did\nobtain animal life of the land which was eaten with their plant foods\nin each case. It was quite important to reach a group of Aborigines who\nhad always lived inland and who were on a reservation inland. This\ncontact was made with the group at a government reservation called\nCherbourg. A typical group of individuals was examined. Of forty-five\nindividuals with 1,236 teeth, 42.5 per cent of the teeth had been\nattacked by tooth decay. For the women, this constituted 43.7 per cent;\nfor the men, 64.6 per cent; and for the children, 5.6 per cent. Of all\nof the individuals here examined 64.5 per cent had dental caries. It is\nof interest that many of these men had worked on white men's cattle\nranches. While the adults showed 11.7 per cent to have deformed dental\narches, this rose to 50 per cent for the children of the group. We were\ninformed that in all of these groups tuberculosis was taking a very\nheavy toll. In Fig. 58, upper left, will be seen a boy with a\nsuperating tubercular gland of the axilla; at the right, a girl with a\nfistula draining pus onto the outside of the face from an abscessed\ntooth; below, deformed legs and a girl with tubercular glands of the\nneck.A reservation situated on the coast where sea foods were\navailable might be expected to make available a particular type of\nnutrition through sea foods. The individuals in a reservation for the\nAborigines at Tweed Heads, which is so situated, were studied. Of the\ntwenty-seven individuals examined, 89 per cent had dental caries. Of\ntheir 774 teeth, 39.7 per cent had been attacked by dental caries. For\nthe women, this amounted to 62.5 per cent; for the men, 70.9 per cent;\nand for the children, 20.8 per cent. Most of these children had been\nborn in this environment while their parents were being fed, largely,\nthe foods provided by the government and mission. In this group, 83.4\nper cent of the children had deformed dental arches, and 33.3 per cent\nof the adults.An interesting incident was brought to my attention in one of\nthe Australian reservations where the food was practically all supplied\nby the government. I was told by the director in charge, and in further\ndetail by the other officials, that a number of native babies had\nbecome ill while nursing from their mothers. Some had died. By changing\nthe nutrition to a condensed whole milk product, the babies recovered.\nWhen placed back on their mother's breast food they again became ill.\nThe problem was: Why was not their mothers' milk adequate? I was later\ntold by the director of a condition that had developed in the pen of\nthe reservation's hogs which were kept to use up the scraps and garbage\nfrom the reservation's kitchens. He reported that one after another the\nhogs went down with a type of paralysis and could not get up. The\nsymptoms were suggestively like vitamin A deficiency in both the babies\nand the hogs, and indicated the treatment.The rapid degeneration of the Australian Aborigines after the\nadoption of the government's modern foods provides a demonstration that\nshould be infinitely more convincing than animal experimentation. It\nshould be a matter not only of concern but deep alarm that human beings\ncan degenerate physically so rapidly by the use of a certain type of\nnutrition, particularly the dietary products used so generally by\nmodern civilization.The child life among the Aborigines of Australia proved to be\nexceedingly interesting. Children develop independence very young and\nlearn very early to take care of themselves. Mothers are very\naffectionate and show great concern when their children are not\nthriving. Two typical mothers with their children are shown in Fig. 59.\nThese children, as suggested in the picture, were keenly interested in\neverything that I did, but were not alarmed or frightened.FIG. 59. Typical Aborigine\nmothers with their children.The wonderful wisdom of these primitive people was attested by\nthe principal of the public school at Palm Island. A mother died and\nher nursing infant was taken care of by its maternal grandmother, who\nhad not recently given birth to a child. She proceeded to carry out the\nprimitive formula for providing breast food by artificial means. Her\nmethod was to make an ointment of the fresh bodies of an insect which\nmade its nest in the leaves of a certain tree. This she rubbed on her\nbreast and in a short time produced milk liberally for this foster\nchild. I was shown the type of insect, photographed its nest and the\ncolony inside when the nest was opened. The people who vouched for this\ncircumstance declared that they had seen the entire procedure and knew\nthe facts to be as stated. They further stated that this was common\nknowledge among the Aborigines.Another important source of information regarding the Aborigines\nof Australia was provided by a study of the skeletal material and\nskulls in the museums at Sydney and Canberra, particularly the former.\nI do not know the number of skulls that are available there for study,\nbut it is very large. I examined many and found them remarkably uniform\nin design and quality. The dental arches were splendidly formed. The\nteeth were in excellent condition with exceedingly little dental\ncaries. A characteristic of these skulls was the evidence of a shortage\nof material for those that had been transferred to a museum from the\ninterior arid plains country. Those skulls, however, that had come from\ncoastal areas where sea foods were available, show much more massive\ndimensions of the general pattern. In Fig. 60 will be seen typical\nskulls showing the normal dental arches and general design of the head.\nIt is of interest to note the very heavy orbital ridges which\ncharacterize this race.FIG. 60. The buried skulls\nthroughout Australia provide a dependable record of their physical\nexcellence and splendid facial and dental arch forms. In the lower\npictures are shown the skull dome of a typical Australian Aborigine for\ncomparison with that of the recently discovered Peking man who possibly\nlived a million years ago.I have previously referred to a report by Professor Weidenreich\nregarding the resemblance of the Australian native's skulls to those of\nthe recently discovered Peking man in the caves of China. In Fig. 60\nare two views for comparison. The skull at the left is that of an\nAustralian primitive photographed in a museum in Sydney, and an outline\nof the Peking skull is shown at the right. Professor Weidenreich has\nemphasized the observations that when three skulls are put in series,\nnamely, the Australian primitive, the Peking skull and a chimpanzee\nskull, the Peking skull appears to be about half way between the two in\ndesign and developmental order. The Australian primitive's skull is\nhigher in the crown, showing much greater brain capacity. The\nsupra-orbital depressions are less deep in the Peking than in the\nchimpanzee, and still less deep in the Australian primitive. The\nsupra-orbital ridges which produce the prominent eyebrows are less\npronounced in the Australian primitive than in the Peking man, and\nstill more prominent in the chimpanzee. The prominent supra-orbital\nridges of the chimpanzee face are shown in Fig. 48.The age of the Peking skulls has been variously placed from\nseveral hundred thousand to a million years. A distinguished\nanthropologist has stated that the Australian primitives are the only\npeople living on the earth today that could be part of the first race\nof mankind. It is a matter of concern that if a scale were extended a\nmile long and the decades represented by inches, there would apparently\nbe more degeneration in the last few inches than in the preceding mile.\nThis gives some idea of the virulence of the blight contributed by our\nmodern civilization.The foods available for these people are exceedingly limited in\nvariety and quantity, due to the absence of rains, and unfertility of\nthe soil. For plant foods they used roots, stems, leaves, berries and\nseeds of grasses and a native pea eaten with tissues of large and small\nanimals. The large animals available are the kangaroo and wallaby.\nAmong the small animals they have a variety of rodents, insects,\nbeetles and grubs, and wherever available various forms of animal life\nfrom the rivers and oceans. Birds and birds' eggs are used where\navailable. They are able to balance their rations to provide the\nrequisites for splendid body building and body repair. In several parts\nof Australia, which originally supported a large population of the\nprimitives, none are left except a few score in reservations. These\nalso are rapidly disappearing. Their fertility has been so greatly\nreduced that the death rate far exceeds the birth rate.This group provides evidence of exceptional efficiency in\nobeying the laws of Nature through thousands of years, even in a\nparched land that is exceedingly inhospitable because of the scant\nplant foods for either men or animals. While the Aborigines are\ncredited with being the oldest race on the face of the earth today,\nthey are dying out with great rapidity wherever they have changed their\nnative nutrition to that of the modern white civilization. For them\nthis is not a matter of choice, but rather of necessity, since in a\nlarge part of Australia the few that are left are crowded into\nreservations where they have little or no access to native foods and\nare compelled to live on the foods provided for them by our white\ncivilization. They demonstrate in a tragic way the inadequacy of the\nwhite man's dietary programs.TABLE OF CONTENTSChapter 11ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED TORRESSTRAIT ISLANDERSIN STUDYING the relationship between\nnutrition and physical characteristics, it is important to make\nobservations at the point of contact with civilization where as few\nfactors as possible in the environment have been modified by that\ncontact. My previous studies have shown that wherever groups of people\nwere utilizing sea foods abundantly in connection with land plants\nincluding roots, greens and fruits, they enjoyed fine physical\ndevelopment with uniform reproduction of the racial pattern and a very\nhigh immunity to dental caries. For this particular study we wished to\nselect a racial group living on islands in tropical or subtropical\nclimate, whose ancestral stocks differed from those previously\nobserved, and which was located at points of contact with modern\ncivilization. A high level of excellence might be expected among the\ngroups who were in process of being modernized but were still utilizing\nthe native foods.For this study the inhabitants of islands north of Australia\nwere chosen in order to record the effect on the Asiatic and Malay\nstocks at the points of contact of the north with the south and of the\neast with the west. In the Torres Strait there are a number of fertile\nislands supporting populations of from several hundred to a few\nthousand individuals each. These groups are in an area of the sea that\nis well stocked with sea animal life, and during the past they have\nbeen sufficiently isolated to provide protection. The racial stocks\nhave retained their identities and include Papuans, New Guineans,\nMobuiags, Arakuns, Kendals and Yonkas. The splendid dental arches of\nthese groups will be seen in the various illustrations. Many of the\ngirls are quite prepossessing, as may be seen in Fig. 61.FIG. 61. The inhabitants of the\nislands north of Australia have splendidly built bodies with fine\nfacial and dental arch form.With the valuable assistance of the officials of the Australian\nGovernment we were able to make investigations on several islands in\nthe Torres Strait. The local administrator provided us with a\ngovernment boat and personal introductions to the local chief and local\nrepresentatives of the government. We were accompanied by the\nadministrator and by the general manager of the government stores.\nThese stores have been located on the various islands, and the profit\nderived from them is used for administrative expenses of the\ngovernment. They provide modern clothing in addition to foods, chiefly\nwhite flour, polished rice, canned goods, and sugar. Studies were made\non the various islands in the order in which the stores had been\ninstalled on them. It is important to have in mind the nature of these\nislands. Some are of volcanic origin and have rugged interiors with\ndeep bays; others are of coral origin. All are in a zone that is\nabundantly supplied with sea animal life, this being the scene of the\nrichest pearl fishing industry in the world.Badu Island had had the store for the longest period, namely\ntwenty-three years. Of the 586 teeth of twenty individuals examined,\n20.6 per cent had been attacked by tooth decay. Of the individuals\nexamined 95 per cent had dental caries. Unfortunately, our stay at this\nisland was accompanied by a torrential downpour which made it very\ndifficult for us to carry forward our investigations. Had we been able\nto examine the mothers the figures doubtless would have been much\nhigher. The children were examined at the school and showed 18.8 per\ncent of the teeth to have been attacked by tooth decay. The men\nexamined showed 21.9 per cent. Figures given me by Dr. Gibson, who had\nbeen taken by the government to the island to make extractions, showed\nthat he found as high as 60 per cent of the teeth had been attacked by\ntooth decay. For the children of this group, 33.3 per cent had abnormal\ndental arches, whereas only 9.1 per cent of the adults' arches were\nabnormally formed.On York Island, 1,876 teeth of sixty-five individuals showed\nthat 12.7 per cent had been attacked by tooth decay. For the women,\nthis was 20.2 per cent; for the men, 12.1 per cent; and for the\nchildren, 7 per cent. For the children, 47.1 per cent had abnormal\ndental arches; for the adults, 27 per cent were affected. The\nindividuals on this island had been in contact with the pearl fisheries\nindustry for several years. Several of the men had been working on the\nfishing boat. Of the sixtyfive individuals examined, 67.6 per cent had\ndental caries.On Darnley Island, thirty-three individuals showed that of their\n900 teeth 5.7 per cent had been attacked by tooth decay. The store had\nbeen established on this island recently. For the women, 16.6 per cent\nof the teeth had been attacked; for the men, 6.3 per cent; and for the\nchildren, 4.1 per cent. On this island, 29.6 per cent of the children\nshowed abnormal dental arches, and 14.3 per cent of the adults. Of the\nwhole group, 46.1 per cent had been attacked by dental caries.On Murray Island where a store had recently been established, of\nthe 1,074 teeth examined for 39 individuals, only 0.7 per cent of the\nteeth had been attacked by tooth decay. For the women, this amounted to\n2 per cent; for the men, 1.7 per cent; and for the children, 0.26 per\ncent. Only 12.8 per cent of the group had dental caries. It is\nsignificant that the natives were conscious of a danger from the\npresence on the island of a store providing imported foods. This had\nbeen so serious a problem that there was a question whether it would be\nsafe for us to land, since on the last visit of the government\nofficials, blood was almost shed because of the opposition of the\nnatives to the government s program. The result of our examination\nindicates that dental caries on these islands shows an incidence which\nhas an apparent direct relationship to the length of time government\nstores have been established there. The immunity to dental caries on\nthis island is nearly 100 per cent. Of the adults, 14.3 per cent had\nabnormal dental arches, and of the children, 34.4 per cent.Thursday Island is the location of the administrative center for\nthe group. Although it is the best sheltered harbor and affords\nprotection for small boats in the Torres Strait, it was not originally\ninhabited by the natives. They considered it unfit for habitation\nbecause the soil was so poor that it could not provide the proper plant\nfoods to be eaten with the sea foods which are abundant about all of\nthe islands. Nearly all of the whites inhabiting the islands of this\ndistrict live on this island. They are the families of the\nadministrative officers and of merchants who are engaged in the pearl\nindustry. Owing to the infertility of the soil, practically all of the\nfood has to be shipped in except the little that the whites obtain from\nthe sea. On the island there were many native families, with children\nattending the native school, while their fathers worked in the pearling\nfleets. Thirty individuals in three fleets were examined, and of their\n960 teeth only thirty-five had been attacked by dental caries, or 3.6\nper cent. Of these thirty individuals, five, or 16.3 per cent had\nabnormal dental arches. The men who had teeth attacked by dental caries\ninformed me that this had happened after they had engaged on the\npearling vessels and began to use the foods provided there. In the\nnative school on Thursday Island twenty-three children were examined.\nThey were living in homes in which a considerable part of the food was\npurchased at the company stores. The incidence of tooth decay was 12.2\nper cent of their 664 teeth. Many of these Thursday Island children had\nbeen born since their parents had begun using the commercial foods\nprovided to the islanders. Among twenty-three individuals, 43.5 per\ncent had abnormal dental arches.While these investigations were planned and carried out\nprimarily to obtain data on the condition of the native races in\ncontact with modern white civilization, wherever possible, data were\nobtained on the whites also. In a school for whites on Thursday Island,\nfifty children were examined with regard to their dental arches, but an\nembarrassing situation was encountered with regard to the sensitiveness\nof the whites in the matter of having their children examined for\ndental caries. Figures were obtained for the facial development which\nreveal that, out of the fifty children examined, 64 per cent had\nirregularities of facial and dental arch development. In the upper half\nof Fig. 62, will be seen a group of children photographed in the native\nschool, and in the lower a group of white girls photographed at the\nwhite school. The difference in their facial development is readily\nseen. The son of the white teacher (Fig. 66, left) had marked under\ndevelopment of his face. The white population lived largely on canned\nfood.FIG. 62. School children from\nthe two groups on Thursday Island. Note the beautifully proportioned\nfaces of the natives, and the pinched nostrils and marked disturbance\nin proportions of the faces of the whites. The dental arches of the\nnatives are broad, while many of the whites have very crowded teeth.\nThe parents and children of the natives used native foods while the\nparents and children of the whites used the modern imported foods of\ncommerce.Hammond Island adloins Thursday Island sufficiently close by to\nbe easily reached in small boats. Accordingly, the people of this\nisland have access to the stores of the white settlement on Thursday\nIsland. Unlike Thursday Island, Hammond Island is quite fertile. Of\ntwenty-seven individuals, all of native stock, 16.5 per cent of their\n732 teeth had been attacked by dental caries, and 40 per cent of the\nindividuals showed some deformity of the dental arches. After examining\nthe children at the mission school, I inquired whether there were not\nfamilies on the island that were living entirely isolated from contact\nwith modern influences. I was taken to the far side of the island to an\nisolated family. This family had continued to live on their own\nresources. They were raising vegetables including bananas, pumpkins,\nand pawpaws. In the cases of the three girls in the family, one with a\nchild five months of age, only six of their eighty-four teeth had been\nattacked by tooth decay, or 7.1 per cent, as compared with 16.5 per\ncent for the entire group on this island. These three girls all had\nnormally developed dental arches and normal features. Three of the\ngirls are shown in Fig. 63. We inquired about the mother and were told\nthat she was out fishing, notwithstanding the fact that the sea was\nquite rough. While we were there, she came in with two fish (Fig. 63).\nHere was one of the principal secrets of their happiness and success in\nlife. The Catholic priest who had charge of the mission on this island\ntold me that this family practically never asked for assistance of any\nkind, and was always in a position to help others. They were happy and\nwell nourished. It is important to note that the progressive\ndegeneration in facial form which occurred in many of the families on\nthe other islands was not found in this family.FIG. 63. These pictures tell an\ninteresting story. The grandmother shown in the lower right knew the\nimportance of sea food for her children and grandchildren and did the\nfishing herself. Note the beautiful teeth and well formed faces of her\ndaughters.The incidence of dental caries ranged from 20.6 per cent of all\nof the teeth examined for the various age groups on Badu Island to 0.7\nper cent, on Murray Island. A group of individuals from this island\nwill be seen in Fig. 64. Note the remarkable width of the dental\narches. Note also in this connection that the natives of this island\nare conscious of the superior food of their locality and wish that\ntheir people were not required to purchase food from the government\nstore. The island is situated on the Barrier Reef and has an abundant\nsupply of small fish. The swarms of fish are often so dense that the\nnatives throw a spear with several prongs into the school of fish and\nwhen the spear is drawn back, there are several fish on it. This\ncondition provides abundant food for sharks many of which could be seen\nsurrounding the schools of small fish. Encircling the group, they\ndashed in, mouths open and gorged themselves with the mass of fish from\nthe water. It seemed quite remarkable that the people were willing to\ngo into the water to spear the fish within the zone frequently\napproached by the sharks, but I was told by the natives that when the\nfish are so abundant the sharks never attack human beings. One of the\nnatives rowed me in his canoe to a point where I could photograph the\nsharks at close range. To show his disdain for the shark, he had no\nhesitancy in standing up in the end of the canoe and hurling his spear\ninto the side of the monster. The spear was immediately thrown out by\nthe shark, which had not been frightened sufficiently to make it leave\nthe scene of action. The sharks in my pictures were swimming so close\nto the shore that the upper part of the tail was forced out of the\nwater, also the back fin, in order to clear the bottom. It was a great\nrevelation to watch the movement of the tail. Instead of swinging it\nfrom side to side like other fish, with which I was familiar, the shark\nwould rotate its tail half or three quarters of a turn in a motion like\nthat of a propeller of a boat, then reverse the motion for the return\ntrip. By a sudden increase of speed in this motion, the shark could\ndart ahead at a rapid rate, corral the small fish by encircling them,\nand finally make a dash through the school with its mouth open.\nHundreds of the small fish, in order to escape, dart out of the water\ninto the air. This exposes them to the birds, a flock of which follows\nthe sharks when they are feeding on the fish. The birds dive down at\nthe time they see the shark making his raid and catch the small fish as\nthey dart out of the water. It is by the birds of prey that the native\nfishermen from their lookout locate the schools of fish. While there is\na difference of opinion as to whether some species of shark will attack\nhuman beings, we saw one pearl diver who bore enormous scars received\nfrom the jaws of a shark.FIG. 64. Natives on the islands\nof the Great Barrier Reef. The dental arches here teach a high degree\nof excellence.The procedure on one island is to snare the sharks by calling\nthem by means of special sounds made by clapping together two large\nhalf shells on the surface of the water. This attracts the shark, and\nthen the men one at a time go into the water with a sharp stick with\nwhich they guard themselves against attack. A noose made of rope of\ncoconut fiber is slipped over the shark's head and over the back fin.\nIt is then allowed to tire out and is brought to shore. It was not\nunusual in a good season for the shark fishers to bring in three or\nfour in a night's fishing. The strength of the native swimmers is\nalmost beyond belief. The pearling boats are frequently in great danger\nof being dashed to pieces on a coral reef, since in those waters gales\nof fifty miles an hour are frequent. We experienced some such gales. On\none occasion, when a pearling boat was wrecked some distance from an\nexposed rock, one strong swimmer rescued and helped two dozen of the\ncrew to the rock, and was himself rescued after being in the water\ncontinuously for thirty-two hours. The pearling boats feed their crew\nlargely on commercial provisions. When the men have been continuously\non the boats for one or two years, or often when they have been at sea\nusing this food for six months, they have rampant tooth decay. When the\ncavities approach or reach the pulp chambers the pain produced in the\nteeth by the high pressure in deep water produces such agony that they\noften have to give up pearling.Physical characteristics of all these residents of the Torres\nStrait Islands, regardless of their tribal group, were, sturdy\ndevelopment throughout their bodies, broad dental arches, and for all\nof those who had always lived only on their native food, a close\nproximity to one hundred per cent immunity to dental caries. These men\nare natural mariners. They do not hesitate to make long trips even in\nrough seas in their homemade crafts. They have an uncanny skill in\ndetermining the location of invisible coral reefs. They relate the\nheight of the swell as it rolls over the reef to particular color tones\nin the water, all of which were too vague for me to see even when they\nwere pointed out.Among the inhabitants of the Torres Strait Islands, almost all\nindividuals who had been born before the foods of modern civilization\nhad become available were found to have dental arches normal in form.\nIn many families, however, living on islands where a store had been\nestablished for some time, and on Thursday Island where imported foods\nhad been available for several decades, many individuals were found who\nhad been born since the use of imported foods. They had gross\ndeformities of the dental arches. This fact is illustrated in Fig. 65\nin which typical depression of the laterals and narrowing of the upper\narch and abnormal prominence of the cuspids due to the lack of space\nfor the normal eruption may be seen. The facial deformity in two white\nboys is seen in Fig. 66. Rampant tooth decay in white children is shown\nin Fig. 67.FIG. 65. The contrast between\nthe primitive and modernized natives in facial and dental arch form is\nas striking here as elsewhere. These young natives were born to parents\nwho had adopted our modern foods of commerce. Note the narrowed faces\nand dental arches with pinched nostrils and crowding of the teeth.\nTheir magnificent heredity could not protect them.FIG. 66. These children are\nfrom the white colony on Thursday Island. Note the pinched nostrils and\ndeformed dental arches with crowding of the teeth. The boy at the left\nis a mouth breather.FIG. 67. As everywhere these\nwhites prefer the modernized foods and pay the penalty in rampant tooth\ndecay. They are in pathetic contrast with the superb unspoiled natives.\nThey are within reach of some of the best foods to be found anywhere in\nthe world and yet do not use them; a typical characteristic of modern\nwhites.We are particularly concerned with data that will throw light on\nthe nature of the forces responsible for the production of these\ndeformities. Since they do not appear to their full extent until the\neruption of the permanent teeth as part of the development of the\nadult, it is easy for the abnormality to be ascribed to the period of\nchild growth. As a result, it has been related to faulty breathing\nhabits, thumb sucking, posture, or sleeping habits, of the child.It would be difficult to find a more happy and contented people\nthan the primitives in the Torres Strait Islands as they lived without\ncontact with modern civilization. Indeed, they seem to resent very\nacutely the modern intrusion. They not only have nearly perfect bodies,\nbut an associated personality and character of a high degree of\nexcellence. One is continually impressed with happiness, peace and\nhealth while in their congenial presence.These people are not lazy, but they do not struggle over hard to\nobtain food. Necessities that are not readily at hand they do not have.\nTheir home life reaches a very high ideal and among them there is\npractically no crime.In their native state they have exceedingly little disease. Dr.\nJ. R. Nimmo, the government physician in charge of the supervision of\nthis group, told me in his thirteen years with them he had not seen a\nsingle case of malignancy, and had seen only one that he had suspected\nmight be malignancy among the entire four thousand native population.\nHe stated that during this same period he had operated several dozen\nmalignancies for the white population, which numbers about three\nhundred. He reported that among the primitive stock other affections\nrequiring surgical interference were rare.The environment of the Torres Strait Islanders provides a very\nliberal supply of sea foods and fertile islands on which an adequate\nquantity of tropical plants are readily grown. Taro, bananas, papaya,\nand plums are all grown abundantly. The sea foods include large and\nsmall fish in great abundance, dugong, and a great variety of\nshellfish. These foods have developed for them remarkable physiques\nwith practically complete immunity to dental caries. Wherever they have\nadopted the white man's foods, however, they suffer the typical\nexpressions of degeneration, such as, loss of immunity to dental\ncaries; and in the succeeding generations there is a marked change in\nfacial and dental arch form with marked lowering of resistance to\ndisease.TABLE OF CONTENTSChapter 12ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED NEW ZEALAND\nMAORIBECAUSE of the fine reputation of the racial\nstock in its primitive condition, it was with particular interest that\nstudies were made in New Zealand. Pickerill(1)has made a very extensive study of the New Zealand Maori, both by\nexamination of the skulls and by examination of the relatively\nprimitive living Maori. He states:In an examination of 250 Maori skulls--all from\nan uncivilized age--I found carious teeth present in only two skulls or\n0.76 per cent. By taking the average of Mummery's and my own\ninvestigations, the incidence of caries in the Maori is found to be 1.2\nper cent in a total of 326 skulls. This is lower even than the\nEsquimaux, and shows the Maori to have been the most immune race to\ncaries, for which statistics are available.Comparing these figures with those applicable to\nthe present time, we find that the descendants of the Britons and\nAnglo-Saxons are afflicted with dental caries to the extent of 86 per\ncent to 98 per cent; and after examining fifty Maori school children\nliving under European conditions entirely, I found that 95 per cent of\nthem had decayed teeth.It will be noted that the basis of computation in the above is\npercentage of individuals with caries. I am using in addition to these\nfigures the percentage of teeth attacked by dental caries. Expressed in\npercentage of teeth affected the figure for Pickerill's group would be\n0.05 or 1 in 2,000 teeth.We were deeply indebted to the government officials in New\nZealand for their invaluable assistance. In anticipation of making\nthese studies I had been in correspondence with the officials for over\ntwo years. When we arrived at Auckland, New Zealand, on our way to\nAustralia, our ship was in port for one day. We were met by Colonel\nSaunders, Director of Oral Hygiene in the New Zealand Department of\nPublic Health who had been sent from the capitol at Wellington to offer\nassistance. A personal representative of the Government was sent as\nguide, and transportation to the various Maori settlements in which we\nwished to make our studies was provided.New Zealand is setting a standard for the world in the care of\ngrowing children as well as in many other health problems. A large\npercentage of the schools in New Zealand are provided with dental\nservice. A specially trained woman was in charge of the work in each\nschool under Colonel Saunders' supervision. The operations performed by\nthese young women on children far exceeded in quality the average that\nI have seen by dentists in America. Their plan gives dental care to\nchildren twelve years of age and under, provided the parents express a\nwish that their children receive that care. The service was being\nextended rapidly to all communities. Since my return, I have learned\nthat the work is being organized to provide for every community of New\nZealand. The art of the Maori gives evidence of their great ability and\nskill in sculpturing. Boys and girls do beautiful carving and weaving.\nAll native buildings and structures are embellished with carvings often\nin fine detail.It was most gratifying to find neat and well-appointed dental\noffice buildings for both natives and whites, located beside a large\nnumber of the public schools throughout New Zealand. In many\ncommunities two or three schools were served by the same operator.\nChildren were either brought to the central dental infirmary or\nprovision was made for an operating room in the vicinity of each\nschool. The operator went from district to district. A typical dental\ninfirmary is shown in Fig. 68, with Colonel Saunders and one of his\nefficient women operators in the foreground. I had suggested that I\nshould be glad to have observers from the Department of Health\naccompany us or arrange to be present at convenient places to observe\nthe conditions and to note my interpretations of them. From two to five\nsuch observers were generally present, including the official\nrepresentative of the department. The planning of the itinerary was\nvery greatly assisted by a Maori member of Parliament, Mr. Aparana\nNgata.FIG. 68. The New Zealand\ngovernment provides nearly universal free dental service for the\nchildren, regardless of color, to the age of twelve years. This is a\ntypical dental clinic maintained in connection with the school system.\nThey are operated by trained dental hygienists. The director of the\nsystem, Colonel Saunders, is seen in the picture.Although New Zealand is a new country with a relatively small\npopulation, there being approximately only a million and a half\nindividuals, the building of highways has rapidly been extended to\ninclude all modernized sections. In order to reach the most remote\ngroups it was often necessary to go beyond the zone of public\nimprovements and follow quite primitive trails. Fortunately this was\npossible because it was the dry season. Even then many streams had to\nbe forded, which would have been quite impossible at other seasons of\nthe year. We were able to average approximately a hundred miles of\ntravel per day for eighteen days, visiting twenty-five districts and\nmaking examinations of native Maori families and children in native\nschools, representing various stages of modernization. This included a\nfew white schools and tubercular sanitariums.Since over 95 per cent of the New Zealanders are to be found in\nthe North Island, our investigations were limited to this island. Our\nitinerary started at Wellington at the south end of the North Island\nand progressed northward in such a way as to reach both the principal\ncenters of native population who were modernized and those who were\nmore isolated. This latter group, however, was a small part of the\ntotal native population. Detailed examinations including measurements\nand photographic records were made in twenty-two groups consisting\nchiefly of the older children in public schools. In the examination of\n535 individuals in these twenty-two school districts their 15,332 teeth\nrevealed that 3,420 had been attacked by dental caries or 22.3 per\ncent. In the most modernized groups 31 to 50 per cent had dental\ncaries. In the most isolated group only 2 per cent of the teeth had\nbeen attacked by dental caries. The incidence of deformity of dental\narches in the modernized groups ranged from 40 to 100 per cent. In many\ndistricts members of the older generations revealed 100 per cent\nnormally formed dental arches. The children of these individuals,\nhowever, showed a much higher percentage of deformed dental arches.These data are in striking contrast with the condition of the\nteeth and dental arches of the skulls of the Maori before contact with\nthe white man and the reports of examinations by early scientists who\nmade contact with the primitive Maori before he was modernized. These\nreports revealed only one tooth in 2000 teeth attacked by dental caries\nwith practically 100 per cent normally formed dental arches.My investigations were made in the following places in the North\nIsland. The Pukerora Tubercular Sanatorium provided forty native Maori\nfor studies. These were largely young men and women and being in a\nmodern institution they were receiving the modern foods of the whites\nof New Zealand. Their modernization was demonstrated not only by the\nhigh incidence of dental caries but also by the fact that 90 per cent\nof the adults and 100 per cent of the children had abnormalities of the\ndental arches.The Hukarera College for Maori girls is at Napier. These girls\nwere largely from modernized native homes and were now living in a\nmodern institution. Their modernization was expressed in the high\npercentage of dental caries and their deformed dental arches.At the Nuhaka school an opportunity was provided through the\nassistance of the government officials to study the parents of many of\nthe children. Tooth decay was wide-spread among the women and active\namong both the men and children.The Mahia Peninsula provided one of the more isolated groups\nwhich showed a marked difference between the older generation and the\nnew. These people had good access to sea foods and those still using\nthese abundantly had much the best teeth. A group of the children who\nhad been born and raised in this district and who had lived largely on\nthe native foods had only 1.7 per cent of their teeth attacked by\ndental caries.The other places studied were Raukokore, Tekaha, Rautoki,\nRotarua, Tehoro, Waiomio, Teahuahu, Kaikohe, Whakarara, Mautauri Bay,\nAhipara, Manukau, Rawena, Ellerslie, Queen Victoria School at Auckland\nand Waipawa.New Zealand has become justly famous for its scenery. The South\nIsland has been frequently termed the Southern Alps because of its\nsnow-capped mountains and glaciers. Of the 70,000 members of the Maori\nrace living in the two islands, about 2000 are on the South Island and\nthe balance on the North Island. While snow is present on many of the\nmountains of the North Island in the winter season, only a few of the\nhigher peaks are snow capped during the summer. Most of the shoreline\nof the seacoast of the South Island is very rugged, with glaciers\ndescending almost to the sea. The coastline of the North Island is\nbroken and in places is quite rugged. The approach to the Mahia\nPeninsula is along a rocky coast skirting the bay. The most important\nindustries of New Zealand are dairy products, and sheep raising for\nwool.The reputation of the Maori people for splendid physiques has\nplaced them on a pedestal of perfection. Much of this has been lost in\nmodernization. However, through the assistance of the government, I was\nable to see many excellent physical specimens. In Fig. 69 will be seen\nfour typical Maori who retained much of the tribal excellence. Note\ntheir fine dental arches. A young Maori man who stands about six feet\nfour inches and weighs 230 pounds was examined. The Maori men have\ngreat physical endurance and good minds. Many fine lawyers and\ngovernment executives are Maori. The breakdown of these people comes\nwhen they depart from their native foods to the foods of modern\ncivilization, foods consisting largely of white flour, sweetened goods,\nsyrup and canned goods. The effect is similar to that experienced by\nother races after using foods of modern civilization. Typical\nillustrations of tooth decay are shown in Fig. 70. In some individuals\nstill in their teens half of the teeth were decayed. The tooth decay\namong the whites of New Zealand and Australia was severe. This is\nillustrated in Fig. 71. Particularly striking is the similarity between\nthe deformities of the dental arches which occur in the Maori people\nwho were born after their parents adopted the modern foods, and those\nof the whites. This is well illustrated in Fig. 72 for Maori boys. In\nmy studies among other modernized primitive racial stocks, there was a\nvery high incidence of facial deformity, which approached one hundred\nper cent among individuals in tuberculosis sanatoria. This condition\nobtained also in New Zealand.FIG. 69. Since the discovery of\nNew Zealand the primitive natives, the Mann, have had the reputation of\nhaving the finest teeth and finest bodies of any race in the world.\nThese faces are typical. Only about one tooth per thousand teeth had\nbeen attacked by tooth decay before they came under the influence of\nthe white man.FIG. 70. With the advent of the\nwhite man in New Zealand tooth decay has become rampant. The suffering\nfrom dental caries and abscessed teeth is very great in the most\nmodernized Maori. The boy at the lower left has a deep scar in his\nupper lip from an accident.FIG. 71. Whereas the original\nprimitive Maori had reportedly the finest teeth in the world, the\nwhites now in New Zealand are claimed to have the poorest teeth in the\nworld. These individuals are typical. An analysis of the two types of\nfood reveals the reason.FIG. 72. In striking contrast\nwith the beautiful faces of the primitive Maori those born since the\nadoption of deficient modernized foods are grossly deformed. Note the\nmarked underdevelopment of the facial bones, one of the results being\nnarrowing of the dental arches with crowding of the teeth and an\nunderdevelopment of the air passages. We have wrongly assigned these\ndistorted forms to mixture of racial bloods.Through the kindness of the director of the Maori Museum at\nAuckland, I was able to examine many Maori skulls. Two views are shown\nin Fig. 73. The skulls belong in the pre-Columbian period. Note the\nsplendid design of the face and dental arches and high perfection of\nthe teeth.FIG. 73. The large collections\nof skulls of the ancient Mann of New Zealand attest to their superb\nphysical development and to the excellence of their dental\narches.One of the most important developments to come out of these\ninvestigations of primitive races is the evidence of a rapid decline in\nmaternal reproductive efficiency after an abandonment of the native\nfoods and the substitution of foods of modern civilization. This is\ndiscussed in later chapters.It was particularly instructive to observe the diligence with\nwhich some of the isolated Maori near the coast sought out certain\ntypes of food in accordance with the tradition and accumulated wisdom\nof their tribes. As among the various archipelagos and island dwellers\nof the Pacific, great emphasis was placed upon shell fish. Much effort\nwas made to obtain these in large quantities. In Fig. 74 (lower), will\nbe seen two boys who have been gathering sea clams found abundantly on\nthese shores. Much of the fishing is done when the tide is out. Some\ngroups used large quantities of the species called abalone on the West\nCoast of America and paua in New Zealand. In Fig. 74 (upper), a man,\nhis wife and child are shown. The father is holding an abalone; the\nlittle girl is holding a mollusk found only in New Zealand, the\ntoharoa; the mother is holding a plate of edible kelp which these\npeople use abundantly, as do many sea bordering races. Maori boys enjoy\na species of grubs which they seek with great eagerness and prize\nhighly. The primitive Maori use large quantities of fern root which\ngrows abundantly and is very nutritious.FIG. 74. Native Maori\ndemonstrating some of the accessory essentials obtained from the sea.\nThese include certain sea weeds and an assortment of shell fish. It is\nmuch easier for the moderns to exchange their labor for the palate\ntickling devitalized foods of commerce than to obtain the native foods\nof land and sea.Probably few primitive races have developed calisthenics and\nsystematic physical exercise to so high a point as the primitive Maori.\nOn arising early in the morning, the chief of the village starts\nsinging a song which is accompanied by a rhythmic dance. This is taken\nup not only by the members of his household, but by all in the\nadjoining households until the entire village is swaying in unison to\nthe same tempo. This has a remarkably beneficial effect in not only\ndeveloping deep breathing, but in developing the muscles of the body,\nparticularly those of the abdomen, with the result that these people\nmaintain excellent figures to old age.Sir Arbuthnot Lane(2)said of this\npractice the following:As to daily exercise, it is shown here that\nevery person capable of movement can benefit by it, and I am certain\nthat the only natural and really beneficial system of exercise is that\ndeveloped through long ages by the New Zealand Maori and their\nrace-brothers in other lands.The practical application of their wisdom is discussed in Chapter\n21.The Maori race developed a knowledge of Nature's laws and\nadopted a system of living in harmony with those laws to so high a\ndegree that they were able to build what was reported by early\nscientists to be the most physically perfect race living on the face of\nthe earth. They accomplished this largely through diet and a system of\nsocial organization designed to provide a high degree of perfection in\ntheir offspring. To do this they utilized foods from the sea very\nliberally. The fact that they were able to maintain an immunity to\ndental caries so high that only one tooth in two thousand had been\nattacked by tooth decay (which is probably as high a degree of immunity\nas that of any contemporary race) is a strong argument in favor of\ntheir plan of life.REFERENCESPICKERILL, H.

JuallancaTABLE OF CONTENTSChapter 13ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS OF\nPERUIN THE foregoing field studies among\nprimitive races we have been dealing chiefly with living groups. Since\nthe West Coast of South America has been the home of several ancient\ncultures, it is important that they be included with the living\nremnants of primitive racial stocks, in order to note the contributions\nthat they may make to the problem of modern degeneration. The\nrelationship between the Andes Mountain Range and the coast and the sea\ncurrents is such that there has been created a zone, ranging from forty\nto one hundred miles in width between the coast and the mountains,\nwhich for a distance of over a thousand miles is completely arid. The\nair currents drifting westward across South America from the Atlantic\ncarry an abundance of moisture. When they strike the eastern foothills\nof the Andes they are projected upward into a region of constant cold\nwhich causes the moisture to be precipitated as rain on the eastern\nslopes, and as snow on the eastern Cordillera Range. Hence the name of\nthe eastern range is the White Cordillera, and that of the western\nrange, which receives little of this rain, is the Black Cordillera.\nBetween these two ranges is a great plain, which in the rainy season is\nwell watered. The great civilizations of the past have always utilized\nwater from the melting snow through irrigation ditches with the result\nthat a vast acreage was put to agricultural uses.The Humboldt Current which sweeps northward from the southern\nice fields and carries its chilly water almost to the equator has\ninfluenced the development of the West Coast of South America. The\neffect of the current on the climate is generally noticeable. One of\nthe conspicuous results is the presence of a cloud bank which hovers\nover the coastal area at an altitude of from one thousand to three\nthousand feet above sea level for several months of the year. Back from\nthe coast these clouds rest on the land and constitute a nearly\nconstant fog for extended periods. When one passes inland from the\ncoast up the mountains he moves from a zone which in winter is clammy\nand chilly, into the fog zone, and then suddenly out of it into clear\nsky and brilliant sunlight. It is of interest that the capital, Lima,\nis so situated that it suffers from this unhappy cloud and fog\nsituation. When Pizarro sent a commission to search out a location for\nhis capital city the natives commented on the fact that he was\nselecting a very undesirable location. Either on the coast or farther\ninland than Lima the climate is much more favorable, and these were the\nlocations in which the ancient civilizations have left some very\nelaborate foundations of fortresses and extended residential areas. The\ngreat expanse of desert extending from the coast to the mountains, with\nits great moving sand dunes and with scarcely a sign of green life, is\none of the least hospitable environments that any culture could choose.\nNotwithstanding this, the entire coast is a succession of ancient\nburial mounds in which it is estimated that there are fifteen million\nmummies in an excellent state of preservation. The few hundred thousand\nthat have been disturbed by grave robbers in search of gold and silver,\nhave been left bleaching on the sands. Where had these people come from\nand why were they buried here? The answer is to be found in the fact\nthat probably few locations in the world provided such an inexhaustible\nsupply of food for producing a good culture as did this area. The lack\nof present appreciation of this fact is evidenced by the absence of\nflourishing modern communities, notwithstanding the almost continuous\nchain of ancient walls, fortresses, habitations, and irrigation systems\nto be found along this coast. The Humboldt Current coming from the ice\nfields of the Antarctic carries with it a prodigious quantity of the\nchemical food elements that are most effective in the production of a\nvast population of fish. Probably no place in the world provides as\ngreat an area teeming with marine life. The ancient cultures\nappreciated the value of these sea foods and utilized them to the full.\nThey realized also that certain land plants should be eaten with the\nsea foods. Accordingly, they constructed great aqueducts used in\ntransporting the water, sometimes a hundred miles, for the purpose of\nirrigating river bottoms which had been collecting the alluvial soil\nfrom the Andes through past ages. These river beds are to be found from\ntwenty to fifty miles apart and many of them are entirely dry except in\nthe rainy season in the high Andes. In the river bottoms these ancient\ncultures grew large quantities of corn, beans, squash, and other\nplants. These plant foods were gathered, stored, and eaten with sea\nfoods. The people on the coast had direct communication with the people\nin the high plateaus. It is of more than passing interest that some\ntwenty-one of our modern food plants apparently came from Peru.Where there is such a quantity of animal life in the sea in the\nform of fish one would expect to find the predatory animals that live\non fish. One group of these attack the fish from the air and they\nconstitute the great flock of guanayes, piqueros and pelicans. For a\nthousand miles along the coast, these fish-eating birds are to be seen\nin great winding queues going to and fro between the fishing grounds\nand their nesting places. At other times they may be seen in great\nclouds, beyond computation in number, fishing over an area of many\nsquare miles. On one island I was told by the caretaker that\ntwenty-four million birds had their nests there. We passed through a\nflock of the birds fishing, which the caretaker estimated to contain\nbetween four and five million birds. On one island I found it\nimpossible to step anywhere, off the path, without treading on birds'\nnests. It is of interest that a product of these birds has constituted\none of the greatest sources of wealth in the past for Peru, namely, the\nguano, which is the droppings of the birds left on the islands along\nthe coast where they have their nests. Through the centuries these\ndeposits have reached to a depth of 100 feet in places. When it is\nrealized that only one-fifth of the droppings are placed on the\nislands, it immediately raises the great question as to the quantity of\nfish consumed by these birds. As high as seventy-five fish have been\nfound in the digestive tract of a single bird. The quantity of fish\nconsumed per day by the birds nesting on this one island has been\nestimated to be greater than the entire catch of fish off the New\nEngland coast per day.In addition to the birds, a vast number of sea lions and seals\nlive on the fish. The sea lions have a rookery in the vicinity of Santa\nIsland, which was estimated to contain over a million. These enormous\nanimals devour great quantities of fish. It would be difficult to\nestimate how far the fish destroyed by this one group of sea lions\nwould go toward providing excellent nutrition for the entire population\nof the United States. The guano, consisting of the partially digested\nanimal life of the sea, constitutes what is probably the best known\nfertilizer in the world. It is thirty-three times as efficient as the\nbest barnyard manure. At one time it was sent in shiploads to Europe\nand the United States, but now the Peruvian Government is retaining\nnearly all of it for local use. They have locked the barn door after\nthe horse was stolen, figuratively speaking, since the accumulation of\nages had been carried off by shiploads to other countries before its\nexport was checked. At the present time all islands are under guard and\nthe birds are protected. They are coming back into many of the islands\nfrom which they had been driven and are re-nesting. Birds are given two\nor three years of undisturbed life for producing deposits. These are\nthen carefully removed from the surface of the islands and the birds\nare allowed to remain undisturbed for another period.A very important and fortunate phase of the culture of the\nprimitive races of the coast has been their method of burial. Bodies\nare carefully wrapped in many layers of raiment often beautifully spun.\nWith the mummies articles of special interest and value are usually\nburied. Implements used by the individuals in their lifetime were also\nput in the grave. With a fisherman there were placed his nets and\nfishing tackle. Almost always, jars containing foods to supply him on\nhis journey in the transition to a future life were left in the tomb.\nIn some of the cultures the various domestic and industrial scenes were\nreproduced in pottery. These disclosed a great variety of foods which\nare familiar to us today. Even the designs of their habitations were\nreproduced in pottery. Similarly their methods of performing surgical\noperations, in which they were very skillful, were depicted.\nFortunately, the different cultures had quite different types of\npottery as well as quite different types of clothing. This makes it\npossible to identify various groups and indicate the boundaries of\ntheir habitations.Their engineering feats disclosed skill in planning fortresses.\nTheir forts were probably impregnable from assault in that day. The\nmaterials used for building their temples, abodes, and fortifications\ndiffer somewhat in various locations. Throughout the greater extent of\nthe coast of Peru, the walls of buildings were made of adobe often many\nfeet thick and sometimes sixty feet high. They had walled cities\nprotected by inner and outer lines of fortifications. It is\nparticularly significant that the hardest metals that they are known to\nhave had were copper and bronze. Silver and gold were quite plentiful.\nTheir surgical instruments were flints and the operations that they\nwere able to perform with these instruments were very remarkable. An\nimportant instrument in warfare consisted of a club with a star on the\nend made of copper or stone. With this the opponent's skull was crushed\nin. One of the amazing features in the various collections of skulls is\nthe large number that show the results of surgical operations. These\noperations were apparently done for the purpose of saving the life of\nthe individual. The procedure was to remove a section of bone in the\ncenter of the depressed area and raise the depressed edges surrounding\nthat area. The fact that a large number of these show abundant evidence\nof healing and repair clearly indicates that the individual lived for\nan extended period following the operation. In some cases, the opening\nis apparently entirely closed in with new bone. Some of these\ntrepanning operations removed a quantity of bone over an area large\nenough for a human hand to pass through. A group of these operated\nskulls are shown in Fig. 75. The owner of the one on the lower row,\nleft, probably died following the operation, as there is no evidence of\nrepair. The others show good healing, which in some is very extensive.\nA study of these trephined skulls reveals that 62 per cent lived for\nmonths or years. In Fig. 75 (lower right), is seen a skull which shows\na large operation. A part of the surgical procedure was to place a\nplate of gold over the opening in the skull for protection. One of\nthese is shown in the upper half of Fig. 76. Below is shown the healed\nscar after removal of the gold plate.FIG. 75. Trephined skulls of\nthe ancient peoples of Peru. Their war weapons were designed to produce\nskull fractures. Their surgeons trephined the skulls, thus removing the\ndepressed area. The large percentage of operated skulls showing\nextensive healing indicates a large percentage lived for months and\nyears afterwards. Their surgical flesh cutting knives were made of\ncopper and bronze, the bone cutting of mounted crystals. They used\ncocoa leaves (cocaine) as a sedative as the natives do\ntoday.FIG. 76. These ancient surgeons\nplaced a gold plate over the skull opening beneath the scalp to protect\nthe brain. Above, two views are shown of a skull with a gold plate in\nposition and below the same skull with the gold plate removed. Note\nthat the skull opening is nearly healed in. To the right below an\nextensive operation is shown.The skill of the surgeons in amputations is illustrated by the\npottery reproductions of amputated parts. One of these, for example,\nshows a man with an amputated foot holding the stump of his leg with\none hand while putting on a sock over the end of the stump with the\nother hand. The technic of amputation is shown in pottery form in Fig.\n77. A serious disease of the foot is suggested, requiring amputation of\nthe leg, high up. Note how the thigh bone was cut so as to provide a\nfleshcovered stump. Below in Fig. 77 is shown a healed oblique fracture\nwith good adaptation.FIG. 77. The skill of the\nancient surgeons in plastic and bone surgery is illustrated in the\npottery jar above. In order to provide flesh for a pad over the\namputated bone stump the flesh is cut lower than the bone by pushing\nthe flesh up at the time the bone is cut. In the lower view good\nhealing is shown of a difficult oblique fracture.When the Spaniards arrived to carry forward the conquest of Peru\nthey found the entire coastal area and upper plateaus under the control\nof a culture organized under the Inca rulers. Prior to the domination\nof that culture, which had its origin in the high plateau country,\nseveral other cultures had developed along the coast in succeeding eras\nof domination. In northern Peru the Chimus developed a great culture\nthat extended over a long period of time. Their capital city was at\nChan Chan, inland from the present coastal port of Saliverry and near\nTrujillo. This city is estimated to have contained a million people.\nThe argument is sometimes presented that at the time these ancient\ncultures lived the coastal areas were not arid desert but well supplied\nwith rain. That this was not so is clearly evidenced by the fact that\nthe walls were built of stucco made by mixing water with the available\nsand and rubble either in continuous molds or in blocks that were built\ninto the fort. Since these blocks were only sun-dried they had very\nlittle resistance to rain. In this rainless desert land they have\ncontinued to stand through many centuries, many of them probably\nthrough several thousand years. There has been a vast change in the\nwalls of the ruined city of Chan Chan within a decade and a half.In 1925 this district was visited by a heavy downpour of rain\nwhich apparently exceeded any precipitation, not only through historic\ntimes, but for many centuries preceding. Temples, courtyards and\nmilitary defenses which were in splendid preservation before that\ndownpour were reduced to a mere semblance of their former structure.\nClearly these great cities and their defenses could not have been built\nof this material in the period when downpours were even occasional, let\nalone frequent.It was, of course, the wealth of the ancient cultures that\nspurred on the conquistadors. It is very difficult to estimate the per\ncapita quantity of gold available in those early cultures. That gold\nand silver were abundant is evidenced by the extensive use that was\nmade of these metals for covering the walls of rooms and decorating\npublic buildings with massive plates, sometimes entirely encircling a\nbuilding and the walls of its various rooms. A considerable quantity of\ngold and silver has been taken from the burial mounds. One burial mound\nis reported to have yielded between six and seven million dollars worth\nof gold. So great has been the activity of the grave robbers that the\nPeruvian Government has placed a ban on this enterprise though for a\nperiod it was allowed on condition that a stated percentage was given\nto the Government.One of the principal characteristics of the Chimu culture of the\ncoastal area of northern Peru is shown in the type of pottery they\nproduced. All articles were realistic in design. The pots show hunting\nscenes, fishing and domestic scenes, as illustrated above. They were\nvery skillful in reproducing features in nearly natural size. Many\nthousands of these portrait jars have been taken from the mounds of\nthis district. The local museum in the vicinity of Chan Chan, under the\nskillful direction of Mr. Larco Herrera at Chiclyan was reported to\ncontain over twenty thousand jars and specimens taken from the\nmounds.To the south of the domain of the Chimu culture, a very strong\nculture was built up with very different characteristics known as the\nNaska. While many of their habits of life, including their methods of\nproviding food, were similar to those of the Chimu culture, they were\nunique in the designs of their pottery, which were characterized by\nbeing allegorical. They used elaborate color designs and fantastic\npatterns. Very little is known as yet of the meaning of much that they\nhave left. While sundials of ancient design and build have been found\nin many parts of Peru, it is not known to what extent they developed a\nknowledge of astronomy. The pilot of the plane that flew us from Lima\nto Arequipa took us over some very strange architectural designs of\ngeometrical patterns which he had discovered and which he suggested had\nnot been reported upon nor interpreted. I photographed some of these\nfrom the air. The straight lines constituting the sides of some of the\ngeometric figures are over a thousand feet long and reveal a precision\nof the angles and a straightness of the ground structures which\nindicate the use of competent engineering equipment and a high\nknowledge of surveying.One of the principal purposes of my trip to Peru was to study\nthe effect of the Humboldt Current, with its supply of human food, on\nthe ancient cultures which were buried along the coast. In other parts\nof the world, where Nature had provided the sea with an abundance of\nsea life which was being utilized by native races, I found quite\nroutinely excellent physical development with typical broad,\nwell-developed facial forms and dental arches with normal contours. In\neach of these groups, the people have reproduced quite closely the\nracial type in practically all members of the group. I have emphasized\nwith illustrations this fact in connection with the Melanesians and\nPolynesians on eight archipelagos of the Pacific Ocean, the Malay races\non the islands north of Australia, the Aborigines of Australia along\nthe east coast; also the Gaelics in the Outer Hebrides, and the Eskimos\nof Alaska.The activity of grave robbers in the ancient burial mounds has\nleft skeletons strewn helter skelter where many of them have been\nweathering, probably for years. While many of these had apparently been\ndeliberately smashed, large numbers were intact, and in a good state of\npreservation. Some of the ancient cemeteries apparently extended over\nareas covering a square mile; and as far as the eye could see the white\nbleaching bones, particularly the skulls, dotted the landscape. Since\nthere were several distinct cultures, I endeavored to make a cross\nsection study of a number of these burial grounds in order that a fair\naverage of specimens might be obtained. The skulls were handled by me,\npersonally, and large numbers of them were photographed. As I have\nmentioned, it was the ancient custom when making the burials to inter\nobjects that were of special interest to the individuals, including the\nimplements with which he had worked. Fishermen's skulls are shown in\nFig. 78 with their nets. It will be noted that all these arches are\nbroad and wide, that the third molars are well formed and almost always\nwell developed, and in good masticating position. Notwithstanding the\nlong period of interment the fabrics buried with these people were\noften in a remarkably good state of preservation. Even the hair was\nwell preserved. A characteristic of the method of preparation for\nburial involved placing over the teeth a preparation that was held in\nposition by a strip of cloth which cemented the teeth quite firmly to\nthis strip with the result that when the mummy cases were torn open the\nremoval of this bandage removed the straight rooted teeth, and\ntherefore large numbers of the skulls that were bleaching on the sandy\nwastes were without the straight rooted teeth. Of course, these would\nreadily tumble out at the slightest jar, after the mummified tissues\nhad decomposed from exposure. The teeth lost in this way would include\npractically all of the upper and lower incisors, some of the bicuspids\nand third molars.FIG. 78. The two skulls in the\nupper photograph apparently belonged to fishermen of the Chimu culture\nas evidenced by the flattened back of the head. Note the splendidly\nformed dental arches. In an examination of one thousand two hundred and\nseventy-six skulls in succession I did not find one with the typical\ndeformities of our moderns.Since our study was primarily concerned with the shape of the\ndental arches and facial form, these characteristics could be studied\nand recorded with the straight rooted teeth removed. Fortunately, there\nare some excellent collections of skulls in museums in Peru, with the\nskulls in position where they can be readily studied for the shape of\nthe dental arches. When we have in mind that from 25 to 75 per cent of\nindividuals in various communities in the United States have a distinct\nirregularity in the development of the dental arches and facial form,\nthe cause and significance of which constitutes one of the important\nproblems of this study, the striking contrast found in these Peruvian\nskulls will be seen to constitute a challenge for our modern\ncivilizations. In a study of 1,276 skulls of these ancient Peruvians, I\ndid not find a single skull with significant deformity of the dental\narches.Since these investigations have apparently established the fact\nthat this problem is related directly to nutrition, and chiefly to\nnutrition in the formative period, and, as we shall see, to a very\nearly part of the formative period, we have here evidence of a system\nof living that is very closely in accord with Nature's fundamental laws\nof reproduction. Several studies have been made dealing with the\nincidence of dental caries or tooth decay among these ancient cultures.\nThe author of \"Bird Islands of Peru\"(1)states\nthat in his examination of fifty mummies in succession he found only\nfour with a tooth with dental caries. This again is in striking\ncontrast to our modernized communities in which from 95 to 100 per cent\nof all the members of a community group suffer from dental caries. I\nhave shown in connection with the Indians of the western coast of\nCanada that in six highly modernized communities where the Indians were\nusing white man's foods, 40 per cent of all the teeth had been attacked\nby dental caries. A similar high percentage was found in the Indians\nnow living in Florida. The ancient burials in southern Florida revealed\napparent, complete immunity. These were pre-Columbian burials.The skill of the primitive cultures of Peru in engineering as\nevidenced by the irrigation systems has always been a subject of\namazement to modern engineers. I visited in a valley fifteen miles from\nthe Santa River an ancient aqueduct which was said to be a hundred\nmiles long. Our guide informed me that he had walked in it for\nthirty-five miles. With its even grades, overflows and auxiliary\nchannels for distribution, its adaptation to the area to be watered,\nand the skill with which it was cut through rock shoulders and its\nretaining walls built, it constitutes a monument to engineering\nability. Modern engineers have estimated that this aqueduct could\ndeliver sixty million cubic feet of water a day. In Fig. 79 will be\nseen a section where it has been carried through a rock cutting and\nbeyond will be seen a retaining wall used to carry the flume along the\nsheer face of a rock. The modern inhabitants of this community have\ncarried away this retaining wall for use in the foundations of their\nhuts. Below, in Fig. 79, will be seen a district of many hundreds of\nacres, possibly a thousand, where the fields are laid out just as they\nwere left hundreds of years ago when the primitive people were driven\nfrom this habitat. All this valley needs is water.FIG. 79. The ancient\ncivilizations of Peru had skilled engineers. In the upper view is seen\none of the ancient aqueducts still intact for thirty-five miles which\nmodern scientists estimate was capable of delivering sixty million\ncubic feet of water per day. They had no hardened tools or blasting\npowder, yet they cut this channel through boulders and rocks. Below is\nseen a valley covering thousands of acres once made fertile by\nirrigation but now an arid desert.In order to reach the burial places it was necessary to drive\nmany hundreds of miles over the arid desert inland from the coast. We\nwere exceedingly fortunate in having as our interpreter and guide Dr.\nAlbert Giesecke, who for fourteen years was the Chancellor of Cuzco\nUniversity. With his excellent knowledge of the country and its\nlanguages, with the credentials which gave us entry to the secluded\nplaces, together with the kindness and helpfulness of the Peruvian\nGovernment officials in almost all localities, we were able to obtain\nmuch valuable information. In an estimate of this culture not only\ntheir arts, but their scientific skill should be included.Since the primary object of this quest was to learn of the\nefficiency of these primitive people in the art of living in harmony\nwith Nature's laws and their methods for accomplishing this, it was\ndesirable to find, if possible, some living descendants of these people\nto gain from them the information that had been handed down. We were\ntold that there were a few villages in an isolated section of the coast\nin northern Peru where the inhabitants claimed descent from the ancient\nChimu cultures of that area. This group was characterized by a\nflattening of the skull at the back which classified them as short\nheads and is readily identified. We were very fortunate in having the\nassistance of Commander Daniel Matto of the Peruvian Army. He was able\nto utilize the police facilities for locating typical old residents who\ncould tell us much of the story of their race and its recent history as\nit had been handed down by word of mouth. In Fig. 80 will be seen one\nof these nonagenarians. He told us of incidents that had been related\nto him by his great-greatgrandfather and by the old people of that\narea, of the coming of Pizarro four hundred years ago. The height of\nthis man can be judged as he is seen standing beside Mrs. Price, who is\nfive feet three. His head is shown both front and side view, revealing\nthe flattened surface at the back. An ancient skull with typical\nflattening is also shown. Fortunately these people are living very\nclosely in accordance with the customs of their ancestors. They are\nfisherfolk, with a hardihood and skill that is in striking contrast\nwith the lethargy of the modernized groups. Their fine physical\ndevelopment, the breadth of their dental arches and the regularity of\ntheir facial features are in striking contrast to the characteristics\nnoted among individuals in the modernized colonies. In Fig. 81 will be\nseen typical members of these colonies.FIG. 80. The ancient Chimus\nflattened the back of the head, as shown in the lower left, by placing\nthe infant on a board. A descendant of the Chimus is shown in the upper\nleft with Mrs. Price, and in front and side views at the right. Note\nthat the back of his head is similarly flattened.FIG. 81. Some descendants of\nthe ancient Chimu culture are still living in a few fishing villages in\nthe north of Peru. They live, as did their ancestors, largely on the\nsea food. Typical faces of this native stock are shown in this\nphotograph. Note the breadth of the dental arches and full development\nof the facial bones.The skill with which these men manage their fishing boats is\ninspiring. Even though the surf was rolling in great combers they did\nnot hesitate to go out in either their small crafts carrying one\nindividual or in their large sailboats carrying a dozen men. The\nabundance of the fish in this district is demonstrated by the large\ncatch that each succeeding boat brought to shore.At the time the Spanish Conquistadors arrived in Peru one of the\nmost unique of the ancient cultures held sway over both the mountain\nplateaus and the coastal plains from Santiago of Chile northward to\nQuito, Equador, a distance of about 1200 miles. This culture took its\nname from the ruling emperors called Incas. The capital of their, great\nkingdom was Cuzco, a city located between the East and West Cordillera\nRanges of the Andes. These parallel ranges are from fifty to two\nhundred miles apart. Between them is situated a great plateau ranging\nfrom 10,000 to 13,000 feet above the sea. The mountain ranges are\nsnow-capped and include in Peru alone fifty peaks that are over 18,000\nfeet in altitude, ranging up to 22,185 feet in Mount Huascaran. Only\nMount Aconcagua in Chile is higher. It is 23,075 feet--the highest\nmountain in the Americas. The air drift is across South America from\neast to west, carrying vast quantities of water received by evaporation\nfrom the Atlantic Ocean. This moisture is precipitated rapidly when the\nclouds are forced into the chill of the higher Andes. In the rainy\nseason the great plateau area is frequently well watered, though not in\nsufficient quantity to meet the needs of agriculture for much of the\nterritory. In the past the precipitation has been supplemented by vast\nirrigation projects using the water from the melting snows. It is\nestimated that the population ruled over by the reigning Incas at the\ntime of the coming of the Spaniards reached five millions.It is probable that few, if any, of the ancient or modern\ncultures of the world have ever attained a more highly perfected\norganization of society than had this Inca culture. The ruling Inca was\na benevolent despot, and according to history unique in that he\npracticed most diligently all of the laws he promulgated for his\npeople. There was no poverty, want or crime. Every man, woman and child\nwas specifically provided with all necessities. The entire amount of\ntillable land was divided so that every man, woman and child had his\nassigned parcel. Everyone worked as assigned by the proper official.\nWhile it is not appropriate here to go into details, it is important\nthat we have a bird's eye view of this great culture for which I will\nquote a paragraph from Agnes Rothery's \"South America, The West Coast\nand The East.\"(2)The people who erected this temple lived in order\nand health, under the most successful communism the world has ever\nseen. Their land was divided into three portions--one portion for the\nInca, one for the Sun, and one for the people, with seventy square\nmeters for every boy and thirty-five for every girl. The live stock and\nimplements were similarly apportioned and the land was ploughed,\nplanted, and the crops gathered in strict rotation. First the fields of\nthe Sun were cultivated, and then the land of the aged, the sick,\nwidows, and orphans was tended; then the lands of the people, neighbors\nassisting one another; and last of all the lands of the Inca, with\nsongs of praise and joy, because this was the service of their King. To\nevery living soul was given his tasks, according to his physical and\nmental capacities. He was prevented from overwork, prohibited from\nidleness, cared for in illness and old age. Children were taken by the\nGovernment when they were five and trained to the profession where they\nwere most needed. There was no hunger, no crime in the whole\nempire.The Inca held his kingly office over the docile,\nindustrious, and contented mass not only through his royal blood, but\nthrough his wisdom and kindness in caring for and guiding his subjects,\nhis bravery in war, and his statesmanship at home. Although he set an\nexample to his subjects by following every law which he promulgated\n(astonishing idea to our modern lawmakers!), he lived, as became his\nrank, in luxury. In his garden were rows of corn moulded from pure gold\nwith leaves of pure silver, and a tassel of spun silver, as fine as\nsilk, moving in the air. Llamas and alpacas, life-sized and cunningly\nfashioned from the same metal, stood upon his lawns, as they did in the\ncourts of the Temple of the Sun.Cuzco, the capital, is reported to have housed about two hundred\nthousand people at the time of the Spanish Conquest. It is situated on\na branch of the Urabamba River in a beautiful valley surrounded by\nfertile mountain sides and towering snow-capped pinnacles. The Urabamba\nRiver drains a large area of the plateau lying to the south of Cuzco\nand has cut a magnificent gorge through the southern range of the Andes\nwhere it passes from the plateau to the eastern watershed and thence to\nthe Amazon. A little to the south of Cuzco the eastern and the western\nranges of mountains approach and combine in a cluster of magnificent\npinnacles and intervening valleys and gorges, that are to be equalled\nby no mountain scenery in the world. Today, almost all travel from the\nAndean Plateau north of this region, as well as from all areas along\nthe coast, must proceed to the coast, thence down the coast by boat to\nthe port of Mollendo which is often dangerous or impossible of approach\nbecause of the heavy seas. The journey is made by train up through\nArequipa and over the western Cordillera Range of the Andes into the\nplateau country and from there northward to Cuzco. So great is this\nnatural barrier that the detour requires many days, and the crossing of\nseveral divides ranging from fourteen to sixteen thousand feet above\nthe sea. This was not necessary for the Incas who had built roads and\nsuspension bridges through these mountains from Cuzco to all parts of\nthe great empire. It is in this mountain vastness that the Inca rulers\nhad constructed their most superb fortresses. While the early Spanish\nconquerors of the country knew that the nobility had great defenses to\nwhich they might retreat, the location of the fortresses was not known.\nTheir greatest fortress was discovered and excavated by Professor C. W.\nBingham of Yale, under the auspices of Yale University and the American\nMuseum of Natural History. This fortress and retreat is now world\nfamous as Macchu Piccu, and probably represents the highest development\nof engineering, ancient and in some respects modern, on the American\ncontinent.We are particularly concerned with the type of men that were\ncapable of such great achievement, since they were required to carry\nforward their great undertakings without the use of iron or the wheel.\nWhile the great Inca culture dominated the Sierras and the coast for\nseveral centuries prior to the coming of the Spanish, and while they\nhad their seat of government and vast agricultural enterprises in the\nhigh Sierras, it is of special interest that many of the most\nmagnificent monuments remaining today in stone were not constructed by\nthe Inca culture, but by the Tauhuanocan culture which preceded the\nInca. The Incas were a part of the Quechu linguistic stock, while the\nTauhuanocans were a part of the Aymara linguistic stock. The Incas had\ntheir capital in the high plateau country about the center of Peru. The\nearlier Tauhuanocan culture centered in southern Peru near Lake\nTiticaca where their most magnificent structures are to be found today.\nOne of the largest single stones to be moved and put into the building\nof a great temple in the history of the world is to be found near Lake\nTiticaca. According to engineers, there is no quarry known in an easily\nreached locality where such a stone could be quarried. It is\nconjectured that it was brought two hundred miles over mountainous\ncountry. It is important to note that many magnificent structures,\nevidently belonging to this ancient Tauhaunocan culture, are found\ndistributed through the Andean Plateau from Bolivia to Equador. Their\nmasonry was characterized by the fitting together of large stones faced\nso perfectly that in many of the walls it was difficult to find a\ncrevice which had enough space to allow the passage of the point of my\npen knife, notwithstanding that these stones were many-sided with some\nof them fifteen to twenty feet in length. In Figure 82 above will be\nseen a section of wall of the great fortress Sacsahuaman overlooking\nCuzco. Modern engineers seem unable to provide a satisfactory answer as\nto how these people were able to cut these stones with the limited\nfacilities available, nor is it explained how they were able to\ntransport and hoist some of their enormous monoliths. The walls and\nfortress of Macchu Piccu, as well as the residences and temples, were\nbuilt of white granite which apparently was taken from quarries in the\nbank of the river Urabamba, two thousand feet below the fortress.\nWithout modern hoisting machinery, how did they raise those mammoth\nstones? In Fig. 82 below is shown a typical section of wall. One stone\nshown has twelve faces and twelve angles, all fitting accurately its\nboundary stones. It is as though the stones were plastic and pressed\ninto a mould.FIG. 82. The primitive peoples\nof the Andean Sierra built wonderful fortresses and temples of cut\nstones which are assembled without mortar and cut to interlock. The\ncentral stone, above, is estimated to weigh one hundred and forty\nthousand pounds. Below the largest stone has twelve faces and twelve\nangles.The country is rugged. Over it passes the highest standard-gage\nrailroad in the world,--about 16,000 feet above sea level. The banks of\nthis river are protected for long distances by ancient stone retaining\nwalls. The native Indians live and herd their flocks of llamas and\nalpacas up near the snow line, largely between 15,000 and 18,000 feet.\nThe Incas and their descendants now occupying the high Sierras in the\nAndes have been thrifty agriculturists. They turn the soil with a very\nnarrow, long, slender bladed spade which they force into the ground,\nand with which they pry the ground up in chunks. They then break up the\nchunks. These spades were originally made of copper which they mined\nthemselves. Cuzco is the archeological capital of South America, but\nits glory is in the ancient fortresses and temples, rather than in the\nmodern structures. As one passes through the streets, he will note that\nin many instances the foundations and parts of the walls of many of the\nmodern Spanish cathedrals and public buildings are of old Inca\nconstruction, of fine stone work surmounted by cheap rubble work and\nmortar superstructure. Whereas the original Cuzco had running water and\nan excellent sanitation system, modern Cuzco has deplorable sanitary\nconditions. The following is quoted from the West Coast Leader,\npublished in Lima, dated July 20, 1937: \"Of a total 3,600 houses in the\ncity of Cuzco 900 are without water or drainage; 2,400 are without\nlight (windows) and 1,080 completely lack any sanitary systems. It is\nnot surprising, therefore, that in some years the death rate exceeds\nthe birth rate.We are particularly concerned in studying these people to know\nthe sources of their great capacity for developing art, engineering,\ngovernment and social organization. Can such a magnificent culture be\nbrought about unless founded on a superb physical development resulting\nfrom purely biologic forces?Earthquakes are very frequent in the Andes. We experienced\nseveral while in Peru. One of these opened up a cave in the\nmountainside in the Urabamba Valley near which we were making studies.\nThe cave had just been explored and a number of ancient burials found.\nI was able to examine a number of skulls from this cave which\napparently represented a pre-Spanish period. The date of the burials\ncould not be determined. The skulls were interpreted as belonging to an\nearly Indian period. In Fig. 83 may be seen two typical skulls. Note\nthe broad sweep of the dental arches and freedom from tooth decay. The\nthird molars (wisdom teeth) are well developed and in normal position\nfor mastication. These are typical of the entire group found in this\nburial place. It is very evident that these individuals were provided\nwith an adequate nutrition throughout the formative and growth periods,\nas well as during their adult life. This is significant because of the\nlimited variety of foods easily obtainable for the people in the high\nplateau country of the Andes.FIG. 83. Typical skulls of High\nSierra Indians from a recently opened burial cave. Note the breadth of\nthe dental arches provided by excellent development of the bones of the\nhead.The ancient Peruvians of both the coastal area and high plateau\ncountry had developed superb physical bodies in each of the several\ncultures. This development had been brought about in spite of the bad\nconditions prevailing with arid desert land extending from the coast to\nthe mountains, and in spite of the severe climate of the high Sierras.\nThe people utilized the wide variety of animal life from the sea in\nconjunction with the excellent plant foods grown in the river basins\nwith the aid of irrigation. Over twenty of our common plants had their\norigin in ancient Peru. In the high Sierras, their animal foods were\nlargely limited to the llama, alpaca and wild animals. Each household,\nhowever, maintained a colony of guinea pigs. Owing to the difficulty of\nboiling in the high altitudes, they found it necessary to roast their\ncereals and meats. Their vegetable foods included potatoes, which were\npreserved in powder form by freezing and drying and pulverizing. Corn\nand several varieties of beans and quinua were their principal cereals.\nThe latter is a small seed of very high nutritive value.REFERENCESMURPHY, R. C. Bird Islands of Peru. New York, Putnam, 1925.ROTHERY, A. South America, The West Coast and the East. New York,\nHoughton, Muffin, 1930.TABLE OF CONTENTSChapter 14ISOLATED AND MODERNIZED PERUVIAN\nINDIANSIN ORDER to understand the living descendants\nof the ancient residents of the high Andes it is essential that we know\ntheir environment. Their climate is cold at night the year around.\nWhile during the winter the snow is deep in the high mountains, there\nis very little on the plateau, since Peru is near the equator extending\nfrom 5 to 16 degrees south latitude. The sunshine is bright and warm\neven in winter. Consequently they have pasturage for their animals the\nyear around.The only native domesticated animals of the Andean Plateau are\nthe llama and the alpaca. Both of these belong to the camel species, as\ndoes the vicuna. The llama is the Indians' beast of burden in the\nAndes. Only the males are used. The animals are very docile and respond\nwith gentleness when treated with kindness. One continually marvels at\nthe ease with which the Indian guides his loaded caravan with soft\nwords or motions, never with harshness. The llama has many unique\nfeatures as a beast of burden. It forages as it moves along and\nconsequently must be driven very slowly. Each animal will carry a\nburden not exceeding a hundred pounds, and if more is placed on its\nback it will immediately lie down until the extra burden is removed.\nThe llama has broad doubletoed feet like the camel which make it very\nsure-footed. It requires no shoeing and exceedingly little care. It can\nthrive, however, only in the high altitudes. The wool of the llama is\ncoarse and is used for heavy, rough garments. The alpaca is a little\nsmaller than the llama and produces a very heavy wool of fine quality.\nAccustomed as this animal is to the severe cold and the high altitudes,\nas well as to the rain and sun, its fleece is both durable and warm. It\nis used extensively throughout the world for suits for aviators. The\nnative colors vary from white to bluish tints and from light to very\ndark browns. It accordingly provides very stable colors for weaving\ndirectly into ponchos and native apparel. The vicuna is a much smaller\nanimal than either the llama or alpaca. It has one of the most highly\nprized coats of fur produced anywhere in the world. This animal has\nnever been domesticated; vast herds have lived wild on the high slopes\nof the Andes mountains. The demand for vicuna fur became so great that\na million and a half of these animals were slain in one year to obtain\ntheir fur pelts. The result is that the Peruvian Government has now\ncompletely forbidden their destruction. The garments of the ruling\nclass of the Incas were made of the vicuna wool.One of the important objectives of my trip to Peru was to find\nand study, if possible, some descendants of these Andean stocks.\nFortunately, large numbers of the Aymara linguistic stock, the\ndescendants of the Tauhuanocan culture, are still residing in southern\nPeru and Bolivia where they are said to retain the essentials of their\nancient methods of living. They constitute the principal native\npopulations in the vicinity of Lake Titicaca and the high mountain\nplateaus of southern Peru and northern Bolivia. I have always\nencountered difficulty in persuading the native peoples to allow\nthemselves to be photographed in their primitive costumes. They are\nusually willing to be photographed provided one will wait for them to\nput on some modern garment.I am reminded of an experience on one of the South Sea Islands\nwhere there was need for roads, but no money with which to build them.\nLaws were passed by the chiefs that anyone approaching a highway in\nnative garb where he might be seen by a foreigner was subject to arrest\nand to payment of a fine which had to be worked out as labor in\nbuilding roads. Of course, on that island no one would allow himself to\nbe photographed without some modern clothing. One boy presented himself\nwearing a single garment, a man's full dress vest, which had evidently\nreached the island in a missionary barrel.The hats in the pictures in Fig. 84 are of native design and\nmanufacture. They are made of fur and are like our modern derbies in\nconstruction.FIG. 84. Descendants of the\nTauhuanocans who were the most famous ancient workers in stone. They\nlive in the high Sierras of southern Peru and northern Bolivia. They\nbelong to the Aymara linguistic division. They make fur felt hats and\nare skilled agriculturists.It is important to note the roundness of the features of the\nAymaras, the wide development of the nostrils for air intake and the\nbreadth of the dental arches. Many of them had been transported several\nhundreds of miles to a coffee plantation because of their adeptness and\nskill in sorting imperfect coffee beans from the run. As I watched them\nI found it difficult to move my eyes fast enough to follow their\nfingers and pick out from the moving run the undesired or imperfectly\nformed kernels. This revealed a superb development of coordination. The\nwisdom of these Aymaras is discussed in Chapter 21.I was very anxious to study the Incas in different parts of the\nhigh Andes, particularly some of the original type in the vicinity of\nCuzco, their ancient capital. Throughout the Andean Plateau, the\nIndians from the higher elevations bring down their wares on market\ndays to exchange with Indians from other localities, as well as to meet\nand visit with their friends. They are very industrious and one seldom\nsees a woman, either shepherding the stock or carrying a burden, who is\nnot busily engaged in spinning wool. While their wool is obtained in\npart from sheep that have been imported, a great deal of it is obtained\nfrom the alpacas which, like the llamas, are raised in the high\naltitudes where the Indians always prefer to live. I was fortunate in\nmaking contact with several groups of Indians in high altitudes through\nthe kindness of the prefects. A group of Indians from the high\nmountains of the Urabamba Valley near Cuzco is shown in Fig. 85. An\nexamination of this group of twenty-five revealed the fact that not one\ntooth had been attacked by dental caries and that, at all ages, the\nteeth normally due were present.FIG. 85. The Quichua Indians\nliving in the high Andes are descendants of the Incas. They live at\nhigh elevations, up to 18,000 feet, where they raise herds of llamas\nand alpacas. They weave their own garments and have great physical\nendurance. They can carry over 200 pounds all day at high altitudes in\nthe manner shown at the lower right.In Fig. 85, lower right, may be seen a typical Indian of the\nAndes carrying a heavy load. The Indians of this region are able to\ncarry all day two hundred to three hundred pounds, and to do this day\nafter day. At several of the ports, these mountain Indians have been\nbrought down to the coast to load and unload coffee and freight from\nthe ships. Their strength is phenomenal.In approaching the study of the descendants of the Inca culture,\nit is important to keep in mind a little of their history and\npersecution under the Spanish rule. To this day they are bitter against\nthe white man for the treachery that has been meted out to them on many\noccasions. Their leader was seized under treachery. The agreement to\nfree him, if the designated rooms were filled with gold as high as a\nman could reach, was broken and their chief killed after the gold was\nobtained. It is recorded that some six million of them died in the\nmines under forced labor and poor foods under the lash of their Spanish\noppressors. In many places they still keep themselves aloof by staying\nin the high mountains of the Andes with their flocks of llamas and\nalpacas. They come down only for trading. As in the past, they still\nweave their own garments. Indeed, they provide practically all of their\nnecessities from the local environment. Their capacity for enduring\ncold is wonderful. They can sleep comfortably through the freezing\nnights with their ponchos wrapped about their heads and with their legs\nand feet bare. They wear two types of head cover, one inside the other.\nSeveral individuals are seen in Fig. 85. Many of them have faces that\nshow strong character and personality.The women of this district wear felt hats which can be turned up\nor down according to the weather. Fine examples of weaving were worn by\nthe women.In Fig. 86 will be seen two young men who had just come down\nfrom the high mountains to a government school. The one in the lower\nphotograph is still wearing his native costume. The one in the upper\nhas discarded his native costume for white man's trousers. Note the\nfine development of his chest, the splendid facial development and fine\nteeth and dental arches. It is important to keep in mind that these\npeople are living in a rarified atmosphere and that, because of the\nhigh altitude, they need greater lung capacity and stronger hearts than\ndo the people living at sea level. The ratio of oxygen content is\nreduced about half at 10,000 feet.FIG. 86. The chest development,\nof necessity, must have large lung capacity for living in the rare\natmosphere of the high Andes. The boy shown above has a magnificent\nphysique, including facial and dental arch development. Below is seen\nthe typical clothing worn up among the snows. Even in frosty weather\nthey are bare below the knees.The broad dental arches of these Indians are shown in Fig. 87.\nNote the extensive wear of the teeth at the upper left. Much of the\nfood is eaten cold and dry as parched corn and beans. Such rough foods\nas these wear the teeth down.FIG. 87. The superb facial and\ndental arch development of these high Andean Indians is shown above.\nThe man at the upper left was said to be very old yet he climbs the\nmountains up into the snows herding the llamas and alpacas. The teeth\nhave a very high state of perfection. Long and vigorous use has worn\nthe teeth of the old people.Market days which usually occur on Sunday present an interesting\nscene. The Indians travel long distances with their wares for exchange.\nThey have no currency and exchanges are made by bargaining.Where these Indians have become modernized, the new generation\nshows typical changes in facial and dental arch form as reported for\nthe other groups. There is also a marked character reaction which will\nbe discussed in detail in Chapter 19. In Fig. 88 are shown four typical\nmodification patterns due to the influence of modernization after the\nfoods of the white man have displaced the native dietary.FIG. 88. The modernization of\nthe Sierra Indians through the introduction of foods of modern commerce\nhas produced a sad wreckage in physique and often character. The boy at\nthe upper left is a mouth breather because his nostrils are too small\nto carry sufficient air. The girl at the upper right has a badly\nunderdeveloped chin and pinched nostrils. Both boys below have badly\nnarrowed arches with crowding teeth.An important item in the life of the Andean Indians is the\nsatisfaction they get from chewing cocoa leaves from which is made our\nmodern cocaine. In order to extract the alkaloid they chew with these\nleaves the ash produced by the burning of a particular plant. This drug\nis chewed as tobacco, one large quid will last for several hours.\nPractically every Indian carries in a little pouch a quantity of these\nleaves in dried form. The effect of this drug is to increase their\ncapacity for endurance. It makes them unconscious of hunger and\nfatigue. Through our interpreter we frequently asked them regarding the\ncomfort or nourishment they obtained from the leaves and were told that\nthey often preferred these leaves to food when they were on a journey\nand carrying heavy loads. I was informed that they can increase the\nquantity of the drug used to a point at which they are quite unconcious\nof pain and able to endure injuries without suffering, and operations\nwithout discomfort. Since packets of these leaves were found in the\nburials near the coast, it is clear that the drugs were used throughout\nPeru in early times. It is also of interest that several of the skulls\ntaken from the cave in the high Andes, were found with trephine\noperations in the skulls similar to those found in the burials along\nthe coast.The physical perfection and development of the present and past\nAndean population has been accomplished in spite of the difficulty of\nbuilding and maintaining good bodily structure at the high altitude\nwhere dairy products have not been and are not at present a large part\nof the nutritional program. In this regard the ancient and contemporary\npeoples of the Andes differ radically from the present and past groups\nof people who live in the high valleys of Switzerland and Tibet where\nmilk is plentiful. The cow, sheep, horse and pig have been imported\ninto the high Andean countries during the last four hundred years since\nthe Spanish Conquests, but they have not acclimatized easily. The\nearlier cultures were of course, dependent upon the llama, alpaca, wild\ndeer, birds and guinea pig for animal foods. While there have been vast\nburial mounds built and preserved in the coastal regions where the\nabsence of rain and the dry sand have added materially to their\npreservation, the rainy seasons have established very different\nconditions for skeletal preservation in the high altitudes.\nNevertheless, a large number of skeletons in good state of preservation\nhave been recovered.The high Andean plateau extends throughout the length of Peru\nbetween the mountain chains. The present Indian stock was studied in\nfour different places in the high plateau country, the farthest north\nbeing Huaras. In this area we were materially assisted by the governor\nof the province who very kindly sent messengers and brought down Indian\nfamilies from high altitudes to the police headquarters at Huaras. This\nplace is at an elevation of about 11,000 feet. We had an opportunity to\nstudy also many who had come from the higher altitudes to the markets\nto sell their wares. Huaras lies in a fertile valley that has been in\ncontact with modern civilization for many decades. This vicinity,\ntherefore, provided a wide range in classes of people, from Indians who\nare isolated to those who are living in highly modernized groups. In\naddition to the opportunity for studying the older people there were\nopportunities for studying adolescents in the two high schools, one for\ngirls and one for boys. Some were pure-bloods who had been highly\nisolated in their formative and childhood periods. The mixed-bloods had\nbeen considerably modernized. There were some whites. I was told by the\nprefect and others who were well informed that there was quite a\ndistinct difference between the Indians who were living in the high\nnorthern Cordillera, the western Andean range called the Black\nMountains, and those living in the eastern range or White Mountains.\nThe latter were physically much better built and were least modernized.\nTypical low immunity to caries and changes in facial and dental arch\nform were found in these modernized groups.Another important area in which the native Indians were studied\nwas Chiclayo. This district is unique in large part because of the\ninfluence of the modern civilization at Lima with which it is connected\nby the railroad. The native market here is very large and occupies\nabout a mile of the main street of the town, through which no traffic\nexcept pedestrian traffic can pass while the market is in session. The\ntown has been under the influence of the Spanish since the time of the\nConquest. It has many colonial buildings and a large cathedral. It has\nnot, however, accommodations for the influx of tourists who come out of\ncuriosity for the purchase of Indian wares. With the aid of the\nprefect, even though no public accommodations were available, we were\nmade very comfortable in the soldiers' barracks. As the Indians came\ndown from the mountains to display and sell their wares, they were\nbrought to us at the barracks. Since this district has been in quite\nintimate contact with the nutrition of the modernized capital, we found\nhere many individuals showing typical degeneration of the teeth and\ndental arches.The adaptation of racial characteristics to the environment in\nwhich they have developed is very strikingly illustrated in the Indian\ncultures of the Amazon jungle district. We were very fortunate in being\nable to make studies of some groups living at present as did their\nancestors through countless centuries in the Amazon basin. We were\ngreatly pleased and impressed with the splendid physiques and fine\npersonalities of many of the individuals of the groups.The abundance of rain, the fertility of the soil and the warm\nclimate make plant growth most luxuriant on the eastern slopes of the\nAndes. It is of interest that in passing from the capital, Lima, across\nthe desert stretch between the ocean and the mountains and then up the\nwall of the Andes to an altitude of sixteen thousand feet and then down\nto the plateau at about twelve thousand feet and up again over the\neastern range and down into the Amazon basin, one has passed through\nthe tropics, temperate zone and sub-arctic zones with varieties of\nplant life corresponding to each. A distance of a few hundred yards\nwill often divide the limits of particular birds and flowers. When one\nreaches the foothills of the Andes on the eastern side, he is in a\nregion of rushing streams teeming with fish, a region of tropical\nfruits and vegetables. It is in this setting that some of the finest\nIndians we have seen were enjoying life in its fullness. The type of\nshelter is very simple, indeed, consisting as it does of a framework\ncovered with banana and palm leaves. We were privileged to meet by\nspecial arrangement about thirty of this tribe who had been brought\nfrom some distance by the officials of the Perene Colony, owned and\noperated by the Peruvian Corporation. In Fig. 89 will be seen the chief\nand one of the noble women of his retinue. They understood that they\nwould have their pictures taken and came dressed in royal regalia.\nTypical countenances are seen in Figs. 90 and 91. These people have\nvery kind faces with broad dental arches, and a high sense of humor.\nThey decorated their faces especially for their photograph. In the\nentire group associated with this chief I did not find a single tooth\nthat had been attacked by dental caries. The fine dental arches are\nillustrated in Figs. 90 and 91. Many of these young men had really\nnoble countenances, such as would rate them as leaders in modern\nscience and culture.FIG. 89. Jungle Indians from\nthe Amazon. This is the chief of a tribe who came prepared to have\ntheir pictures taken in their tribal regalia. Note the splendid\nfeatures of both and the noble carriage of the woman.FIG. 90. The facial and dental\narch development of the jungle Indians was superb and the teeth were\nexcellent and free from dental caries. Note the complete development of\nthe dental arches and nostrils.FIG. 91. The excellence of\nskeletal development of the jungle Indians as expressed in the faces\nand dental arches, is illustrated in these views. Their foods were\nselected from the animal life of the streams and the bush together with\nnative plants.In another tribe, however, of the same racial stock, efforts to\nmodernize had been in operation for some time by a mission. The food of\nthis latter group had been distinctly affected by their contact with\nthe modern group. By reducing the animal foods, the change in physical\nefficiency, and appearance of tooth decay, is most marked. In Fig. 92\nabove will be seen typical cases of rampant tooth decay with extensive\nloss of the teeth. In Fig. 92 below are shown two of the first\ngeneration following the adoption of the modernized type of diet in\nthis group. Note the narrowing of the faces with crowding of the teeth.\nNote the deformed dental arches.FIG. 92. At the point of\ncontact of these jungle Indians with modernization where it included a\nchange from their native diet tooth decay became rampant as shown. A\nmarked change in facial form occurred accompanied by crowding of the\nteeth in the new generation.The native foods of these Amazon Jungle Indians included the\nliberal use of fish which are very abundant in both the Amazon and its\nbranches, particularly in the foothill streams; animal life from the\nforest and thickets; bird life, including many water fowl and their\neggs; plants and fruits. They use very large quantities of yucca which\nis a starchy root quite similar to our potato in chemical content. This\nis not the yucca of North America.The Peruvian Indians, in the highlands and in the eastern\nwatershed of the Andes, and also in the Amazon Basin, have built superb\nbodies with high immunity to dental caries and with splendidly\ndeveloped facial and dental arch forms while living on the native foods\nin accordance with their accumulated wisdom. Whenever they have adopted\nthe foods of modern civilization and have displaced their own\nnutrition, dental caries has been found to be wide-spread; and in the\nsucceeding generations following the adoption of modern foods, a change\nin facial and dental arch forms has developed. The modernized foods\nwhich displaced their native foods were the typical white man's dietary\nof refined-flour products, sugar, sweetened foods, canned goods, and\npolished rice.TABLE OF CONTENTSChapter 15CHARACTERISTICS OF PRIMITIVE ANDMODERNIZED DIETARIESIF PRIMITIVE races have been more efficient\nthan modernized groups in the matter of preventing degenerative\nprocesses, physical, mental and moral, it is only because they have\nbeen more efficient in complying with Nature's laws. We have two\nprocedures that we can use for evaluating their programs: first, the\ninterpretation of their data in terms of our modern knowledge; and\nsecond, the clinical application of their procedures to our modern\nsocial problems. Specifically, since the greater success of the\nprimitives in meeting Nature's laws has been based primarily on dietary\nprocedures, it becomes desirable first, to evaluatetheir dietary\nprograms on the basis of known biologic requirements for comparison\nwith the foods of our modern civilization; and second, to test their\nprimitive nutritional programs by applying their equivalents to our\nmodern families.The advance in our knowledge of body-building and body-repairing\nmaterials from a biochemical standpoint makes it possible even with our\nlimited knowledge of organic catalysts, to draw comparisons between the\nprimitive and modernized dietaries. If we use the generally accepted\nminimal and optimal quantities of the various minerals and vitamins\nrequired, as indicated by Sherman,(1)we shall\nhave at once a yardstick for evaluating the primitive dietaries.Of the eighteen elements of which the human body is composed,\nall of which are presumably essential, several are needed in very small\nquantities. A few are required in liberal quantities. The normal adult\nneeds to receive from the foods eaten one-half to one gram of calcium\nor lime per day. Few people receive more than one-half of the minerals\npresent in the food. The requirements of phosphorus are approximately\ntwice this amount. Of iron we need from one-seventh to one-third of a\ngram per day. Smaller amounts than these are required of several other\nelements. In order to utilize these minerals, and to build and maintain\nthe functions of various organs, definite quantities of various organic\ncatalysts which act as activating substances are needed. These include\nthe known and unknown vitamins.Unlike some experimental animals human beings have not the\nability to create some special chemical substances (not elements) such\nas vitamins within their bodies. Several animals have this capacity.\nFor example, scurvy, which is due to a lack of vitamin C, cannot be\nproduced readily in rats because rats can manufacture vitamin C.\nSimilarly, rickets cannot be produced easily in guinea pigs, because\nthey can synthesize vitamin D. The absence of vitamin D and adequate\nminerals produces rickets in young human beings. Neither rickets nor\nscurvy can be produced readily in dogs because of the dogs' capacity to\nsynthesize both vitamins C and D. We are not so fortunate. Similarly,\nthe absence of vitamin B (B1) produces in birds\nand man severe nervous system reactions, such as beri-beri. These\nsymptoms are often less pronounced, or quite different, in other\nanimals.From our knowledge of the dietaries used by the various\nprimitive racial stocks we can calculate the approximate amounts of the\nminerals and vitamins provided by those dietaries, for comparison with\nthe amounts provided by modernized foods. Our problem is simplified by\nthe fact that the food of the white man in various parts of the world\nbeing built from a few fundamental food factors, has certain quite\nconstant characteristics. Hence the displacing diets are similar for\nthe several modernized groups herewith considered.As a further approach to our problem, it is important to keep in\nmind that, in general, the wild animal life has largely escaped many of\nthe degenerative processes which affect modern white peoples. We\nascribe this to animal instinct in the matter of food selection. It is\npossible that man has lost through disuse some of the normal faculty\nfor consciously recognizing body requirements. In other words, the only\nhunger of which we now are conscious is a hunger for energy to keep us\nwarm and to supply power. In general, we stop eating when an adequate\namount of energy has been provided, whether or not the body building\nand repairing materials have been included in the food. The heat and\nenergy factor in our foods is measured in calories. In planning an\nadequate diet, a proper ratio between body building and energy units\nmust be maintained. It is important to keep in mind that while the\namount of body-building and repairing material required is similar for\ndifferent individuals of the same age and weight, it is markedly\ndifferent for two individuals, one of whom is leading a sedentary, and\nthe other, an active life. Similarly, there is a great difference\nbetween the amount of body-building and repairing material required by\na growing child or an expectant mother and an average adult.There are certain characteristics of the various dietaries of\nthe primitive races, which are universally present when that dietary\nprogram is associated with a high immunity to disease and freedom from\ndeformities. In general, these are the foods that provide adequate\nsources of body-building and body-repairing material. The use by\nprimitives, of foods relatively low in calories has resulted in forcing\nthem to eat large quantities of these foods, in order to provide the\nheat and energy requirements of the body. The primitives have obtained,\noften with great difficulty, foods that are scarce but rich in certain\nelements. In these rare foods were elements which the body requires in\nsmall quantities, including minerals such as iodine, copper, manganese\nand special vitamins. In connection with the vitamins it should be kept\nin mind that our knowledge of these unique organic catalysts is\nlimited. The medical profession and the public at large think of\nvitamin D as consisting of just one chemical factor, whereas,\ninvestigations are revealing continually new and additional factors. A\nrecent review(2)describes in considerable\ndetail eight distinct factors in vitamin D and refers to information\nindicating that there may be at least twelve. Clearly, it is not\npossible to undertake to provide an adequate nutrition simply by\nreinforcing the diet with a few synthetic products which are known to\nrepresent certain of these nutritional factors. By the mass of the\npeople at large, as well as by members of the medical profession,\nactivated ergosterol is considered to include all that is necessary to\nsupply the vitamin D group of activators to human nutrition.The various dietary programs of primitive races which appear to\nbe successful in controlling dental caries and deformities may be\ndivided into three groups based upon the sources from which they derive\nthe minerals and fat-soluble activators. I do not use the term vitamins\nexclusively because as yet little is known about the whole group of\norganic catalysts, although we have considerable knowledge of the\nlimited number which are designated by the first half dozen letters of\nthe alphabet. Most lay people and members of the medical and dental\nprofessions assume that the six or eight vitamins constitute\npractically all that are needed in an adequate nutrition. These organic\nactivators can be divided into two main groups, water-soluble and\nfat-soluble. An essential characteristic of the successful dietary\nprograms of primitive races has been found to relate to a liberal\nsource of the fat-soluble activator group.When we discuss the successful dietary programs of the various\ngroups from the standpoint of their ability to control tooth decay and\nprevent deformity we find that for the people in the high and isolated\nAlpine valleys their nutrition is dependent largely on entire rye bread\nand dairy products with meat about once a week and various vegetables,\nfresh in the summer season and stored for the winter season. An\nanalysis in my laboratory of the dairy products obtained from the\nLoetschental Valley in Switzerland through a series of years has shown\nthe vitamin content to be much higher than the average throughout the\nworld for similar foods during the same seasons. The milk in these high\nvalleys is produced from green pasturage and stored green hay of\nexceptionally high chlorophyll content. The milk and the rye bread\nprovided minerals abundantly.The diet of the people in the Outer Hebrides which proved\nadequate for maintaining a high immunity to dental caries and\npreventing deformity consisted chiefly of oat products and sea foods\nincluding the wide variety of fish available there. This diet included\ngenerally no dairy products since the pasture was not adequate for\nmaintaining cattle. Oat grain was the only cereal that could be matured\nsatisfactorily in that climate. Some green foods were available in the\nsummer and some vegetables were grown and stored for winter. This diet,\nwhich included a liberal supply of fish, included also the use of\nlivers of fish. One important fish dish was baked cod's head that had\nbeen stuffed with oat meal and chopped cods' livers. This was an\nimportant inclusion in the diets of the growing children. The oats and\nfish, including livers, provided minerals and vitamins adequate for an\nexcellent racial stock with high immunity to tooth decay.For the Eskimos of Alaska the native diet consisted of a liberal\nuse of organs and other special tissues of the large animal life of the\nsea, as well as of fish. The latter were dried in large quantities in\nthe summer and stored for winter use. The fish were also eaten frozen.\nSeal oil was used freely as an adjunct to this diet and seal meat was\nspecially prized and was usually available. Caribou meat was sometimes\navailable. The organs were used. Their fruits were limited largely to a\nfew berries including cranberries, available in the summer and stored\nfor winter use. Several plant foods were gathered in the summer and\nstored in fat or frozen for winter use. A ground nut that was gathered\nby the Tundra mice and stored in caches was used by the Eskimos as a\nvegetable. Stems of certain water grasses, water plants and bulbs were\noccasionally used. The bulk of their diet, however, was fish and large\nanimal life of the sea from which they selected certain organs and\ntissues with great care and wisdom. These included the inner layer of\nskin of one of the whale species, which has recently been shown to be\nvery rich in vitamin C. Fish eggs were dried in season. They were used\nliberally as food for the growing children and were recognized as\nimportant for growth and reproduction. This successful nutrition\nprovided ample amounts of fat-soluble activators and minerals from sea\nanimal life.For the Indians living inside the Rocky Mountain Range in the\nfar North of Canada, the successful nutrition for nine months of the\nyear was largely limited to wild game, chiefly moose and caribou.\nDuring the summer months the Indians were able to use growing plants.\nDuring the winter some use was made of bark and buds of trees. I found\nthe Indians putting great emphasis upon the eating of the organs of the\nanimals, including the wall of parts of the digestive tract. Much of\nthe muscle meat of the animals was fed to the dogs. It is important\nthat skeletons are rarely found where large game animals have been\nslaughtered by the Indians of the North. The skeletal remains are found\nas piles of finely broken bone chips or splinters that have been\ncracked up to obtain as much as possible of the marrow and nutritive\nqualities of the bones. These Indians obtain their fat-soluble vitamins\nand also most of their minerals from the organs of the animals. An\nimportant part of the nutrition of the children consisted in various\npreparations of bone marrow, both as a substitute for milk and as a\nspecial dietary ration.In the various archipelagos of the South Pacific and in the\nislands north of Australia, the natives depended greatly on shell fish\nand various scale fish from adjacent seas. These were eaten with an\nassortment of plant roots and fruits, raw and cooked. Taro was an\nimportant factor in the nutrition of most of these groups. It is the\nroot of a species of lily similar to \"elephant ears\" used for garden\ndecorations in America because of its large leaves. In several of the\nislands the tender young leaves of this plant were eaten with coconut\ncream baked in the leaf of the tia plant. In the Hawaiian group of\nislands the taro plant is cooked and dried and pounded into powder and\nthen mixed with water and allowed to ferment for twenty-four hours,\nmore or less, in accordance with the stiffness of the product desired.\nThis is called poi. Its use in this form was comparable in efficiency\nwith its use on other archipelagos as a boiled root served much as we\nuse potatoes. For these South Sea Islanders fat-soluble vitamins and\nmany of the minerals were supplied by the shell-fish and other animal\nlife from the sea.The native tribes in eastern and central Africa, used large\nquantities of sweet potatoes, beans, and some cereals. Where they were\nliving sufficiently near fresh water streams and lakes, large\nquantities of fish were eaten. Goats or cattle or both were\ndomesticated by many tribes. Other tribes used wild animal life quite\nliberally. Some very unique and special sources of vitamins were used\nby some of these tribes. For example, in certain seasons of the year\ngreat swarms of a large winged insect develop in Lake Victoria and\nother lakes. These often accumulated on the shores to a depth of many\ninches. They were gathered, dried and preserved to be used in puddings\nwhich are highly prized by the natives and are well spoken of by the\nmissionaries. Another insect source of vitamins used frequently by the\nnatives is the ant which is collected from great ant hills that in many\ndistricts grow to heights of ten feet or more. In the mating season the\nants develop wings and come out of the ant hills in great quantities\nand go into the air for the mating process. These expeditions are\nfrequently made during or following a rain. The natives have developed\nprocedures for inducing these ants to come out by covering over the\nopening with bushes to give the effect of clouds and then pounding on\nthe ground to give an imitation of rain. We were told by the\nmissionaries that one of the great luxuries was an ant pie but\nunfortunately they were not able to supply us with this delicacy. Parts\nof Africa like many other districts are often plagued by vast swarms of\nlocusts. These are gathered in large quantities, to be cooked for\nimmediate use or dried and ground into a flour for later use. They\nprovide a rich source of minerals and vitamins. The natives of Africa\nused the cereals maize, beans, linga linga, millet, and Kaffir corn,\ncooked or roasted. Most of these were ground just before cooking.Among the Aborigines of Australia we found that those living\nnear the sea were using animal life from that source liberally,\ntogether with the native plants and animals of the land. They have not\ncultivated the land plants during their primitive life. In the\ninterior, they use freely the wild animal life, particularly wallaby,\nkangaroo, small animals and rodents. All of the edible parts, including\nthe walls of the viscera and internal organs are eaten.The native Maori in New Zealand, used large quantities of foods\nfrom the sea, wherever these were available. Even in the inland food\ndepots, mutton birds were still available in large quantities. These\nbirds were captured just before they left the nests. They developed in\nthe rockeries about the coast, chiefly on the extreme southern coast of\nthe South Island. At this stage, the flesh is very tender and very fat\nfrom the gorging that has been provided by their parent. The value of\nthis food for the treatment of tuberculosis was being heralded quite\nwidely in both Australia and New Zealand. In the primitive state of the\nislands large quantities of land birds were available and because of\nthe fertility of the soil and favorable climate, vegetables and fruits\ngrew abundantly in the wild. Large quantities of fern root were used.\nWhere groups of the Maori race were found isolated sufficiently from\ncontact with modern civilization and its foods to be dependent largely\non the native foods, they selected with precision certain shell-fish\nbecause of their unique nutritive value.A splendid illustration of the primitive Maori instinct or\nwisdom regarding the value of sea foods was shown in an experience we\nhad while making examinations in a native school on the east coast of\nthe North Islands. I was impressed with the fact that the children in\nthe school gave very little evidence of having active dental caries. I\nasked the teacher what the children brought from their homes to eat at\ntheir midday lunch, since most of them had to come too great a distance\nto return at noon. I was told that they brought no lunch but that when\nschool was dismissed at noon the children rushed for the beach where,\nwhile part of the group prepared bonfires, the others stripped and\ndived into the sea, and brought up a large species of lobster. The\nlobsters were promptly roasted on the coals and devoured with great\nrelish. Other sea foods are pictured in Fig. 74.The native diet of the tribes living in the islands north of\nAustralia consisted of liberal quantities of sea foods. These were\neaten with a variety of plant roots and greens, together with fruits\nwhich grew abundantly in that favorable climate. Few places in the\nworld have so favorable a quantity of food for sea-animal life as these\nwaters which provide the richest pearl fisheries in the world. This is\nevidence of the enormous quantity of shell-fish that develop there.\nHere, as off the east coast of Australia, are to be found some of the\nlargest shell-fish of the world. It was a common occurrence to see\nthese shells being used by natives for such purposes as water storage\nand for bath tubs of a size approximately that of a wash tub. Australia\nand New Zealand are near enough to the Antarctic ice cap to have their\nshores bathed with currents coming from the ice fields, currents which\nabound in food for sea animals. The great barrier reef off the east\ncoast of Australia extends north to within a few leagues of New Guinea.\nMurray Island is near the north end of this barrier. The fish in the\nwater at times form such a dense mass that they can be scooped into the\nboats directly from the sea. Fishermen wading out in the surf and\nthrowing their spears into the schools of fish usually impale one or\nseveral.The incidence of tooth decay on this island was less than one\nper cent of all of the teeth examined. Another important sea food in\nthese waters was dugong, referred to as sea cow in northern waters.\nThis animal is very highly prized but is becoming scarce. We found its\nmeat very much like lamb. It lives on the vegetation of the sea floor\nin shallow water. As we flew over the bays of Eastern Australia going\nnorthward in search of colonies of native Aborigines, we could see\nthese sea animals pasturing in the clear water among the ocean\nplants.During these investigations of primitive races, I have been\nimpressed with the superior quality of the human stock developed by\nNature wherever a liberal source of sea foods existed. These zones of\nabundant marine life were largely in the wake of the ocean currents\ndrifting from the ice fields of the poles. The Humboldt Current is\nprobably the most liberal carrier of marine life of any of the ocean\ncurrents. It leaves the ice field of the Antarctic and bathes the west\ncoast of South America from its southern tip nearly to the equator,\nwhere the coast line changes direction and the Humboldt Current is\ndeflected out into the ocean. It meets here a warm current coming down\nfrom the coast of Central America, Panama and Columbia. If the superb\nphysiques that Nature has established among the Maori of New Zealand,\nthe Malays of the Islands north of Australia, the Gaelics of the Outer\nHebrides and the natives on several of the archipelagos of the Pacific,\nowe their superior physical development to sea foods, we should expect\nto find that the tribes which have had contact with the great Humboldt\nCurrent food would also have superb physiques. Unfortunately, very\nlittle has been known of the ancient cultures that have developed along\nthe coast of Chile and Peru. It has been reported that of all the\nIndian tribes of South America, those in Patagonia were the most\nstalwart. While the west coast of Peru is bathed by the Humboldt\nCurrent with its nearly inexhaustible supply of human nutrition, the\nlands bordering that shore are among the most desolate deserts of the\nworld. The zone between the Andes Mountains and the coast for\napproximately a thousand miles is utterly barren, consisting of moving\nsand dunes and jagged promontories. Practically the only break in this\nwaterless, treeless desert is to be found in the few ribbons of water\nthat trickle down from the melting snows of the Andes Coastal Range.\nThis coast has no rainy seasons. Any vegetation grown, now or in the\npast thousands of years, has had to be watered from the limited supply\nafforded by these rivers which seem so insignificant when compared with\nthe vastness of the territory. These river bottoms contain the alluvial\ndeposits from the Andes and are very rich when watered. It has been\nonly by means of gigantic engineering undertakings that the water from\nthese rivers has been carried through great irrigation ditches,\nsometimes fifty to a hundred miles long for the purpose of making it\npossible to utilize these river bottom lands for agriculture.In many of the primitive tribes living by the sea we found\nemphasis on the value of fish eggs and on some animal forms for\ninsuring a high physical development of growing children, particularly\nof girls, and a high perfection of offspring through a reinforcement of\nthe mother's nutrition. It is also important to note that in several of\nthe primitive tribes studied there has been a consciousness that not\nonly the mother should have special nutrition, but also the father. In\nthis group very great value was placed upon a product obtained from a\nsea form known locally as the angelote or angel fish, which in\nclassification is between a skate and a shark. The young of the\nangelota are born alive, ready for free swimming and capable of\nforaging for themselves immediately at birth. Twenty to thirty young\nare born in one litter. The eggs of the female before fertilization are\nabout one inch in diameter, slightly oval but nearly spherical. They\nare used as food by all, but the special food product for men is a pair\nof glands obtained from the male. These glands weigh up to a pound\neach, when they are dried. They have a recognized value among the\nnatives for treating cases of tuberculosis, especially for controlling\nlung hemorrhages. The sea foods were used in conjunction with the land\nplants and fruits raised by means of irrigation in the river valleys.\nTogether these foods provided adequate nutrition for maintaining high\nphysical excellence.In Chapter 13 I have discussed the probable order of these\nancient cultures and the possible extent of their duration. Very little\nis known of their origin. Evidence has recently been discovered in\nPanama indicating that both the wealth and the culture of Peru were\ncarried northward by maritime conquerors and that the cultures of\nCentral America, including the Maya culture may have had their origins\nin these ancient cultures of Peru.While the coastal area of Peru saw the development of many\nmagnificent cultures through past ages, the highlands of Peru also have\nleft much evidence of superior attainments and wisdom. The two great\nIndian linguistic groups of the Andean highlands of today are the\nAymara of Southern Peru and Bolivia and the Quichus of central and\nnorthern Peru. The Aymara are credited with being the descendants of\nthe Tauhuanocan culture which preceded the Incan culture in the\nhighlands. The Quichu are credited with being the descendants of the\nIncan culture which had its zenith just prior to the coming of the\nSpaniards. In Chapter 14 I have shown photographs of these racial\nstocks as they are found today in the Andean Sierras. It may be\npossible that in former times the vast mountain ranges provided large\nherds of grazing wild animals of the deer family. Because of the\nvastness of the population and the extent to which all available land\nsurfaces were utilized for agriculture, it does not seem possible that\nwild animal life could have been an adequate source of nutrition. The\nmembers of the camel family, the llamas, alpacas, and vicunas were\nutilized for food. Of these the first two were used to considerable\nextent as they are today. When it is recognized that in the Sierra the\navailable water is largely that provided to the streams from the\nmelting snows and from rains in the rainy season, it will be realized\nthat these sources of fresh water could not provide the liberal\nquantity of iodine essential for human growth and development. It was,\naccordingly, a matter of great interest to discover that these Indians\nused regularly dried fish eggs from the sea. Commerce in these dried\nfoods is carried on today as it no doubt has been for centuries. When I\ninquired of them why they used this material they explained that it was\nnecessary to maintain the fertility of their women. I was informed also\nthat every exchange depot and market carried these dried fish eggs so\nthat they were always available. Another sea product of very great\nimportance, and one which was universally available was dried kelp.\nUpon inquiry I learned that the Indians used it so that they would not\nget \"big necks\" like the whites. The kelp provided a very rich source\nof iodine as well as of copper, which is very important to them in the\nutilization of iron for building an exceptionally efficient quality of\nblood for carrying oxygen liberally at those high altitudes. An\nimportant part of their dietary consists today as in the past of\npotatoes which are gathered and frozen, dried and powdered, and\npreserved in the powdered form. This powder is used in soups with llama\nmeat and other products. Since the vitamin D group of activators is\nabsent from nearly all plant products but must be synthesized in animal\nbodies from the plant foods, where it is largely stored in organs, an\nadequate source had to be provided. The Indians of the highlands of\nPeru maintained colonies of guinea pigs which were used in their stews.\nThe ancient burials also show that the guinea pig was a common source\nof food since mummified bodies of this animal were found. This is\nsignificant since of all the animals that are used for experimental\nwork the guinea pig is probably the most efficient in synthesizing\nvitamin D from plant foods. They are very hardy. They live on a great\nvariety of green plant foods and twigs and are very prolific. They\napparently played a very important part in the physical excellence of\nthe ancient cultures.It is unfortunate that as the white man has come into contact\nwith the primitives in various parts of the world he has failed to\nappreciate the accumulated wisdom of the primitive racial stocks. Much\nvaluable wisdom has been lost by this means. I have referred to the\nskill of the Indians in preventing scurvy and to the many drugs that we\nuse which the white man has learned of from the primitives.In this connection the Indians of British Columbia, who have\nbeen so efficient in preventing scurvy, have a plant product for the\nprevention and cure of diabetes. This has recently become known to the\nwhite man through the experience of a patient who was brought into the\nhospital at Prince Rupert, British Columbia, as reported in the\nCanadian Medical Journal, July 1938. Prince Rupert is near the boundary\nbetween British Columbia and Alaska on the coast. The patient came to\nthat hospital for an operation and suddenly showed signs of diabetes,\nwhich required treatment with large doses of insulin. Dr. Richard\nGeddes Large asked him regarding the history of his affection and what\nhe had been taking. He was told that for several years he had been\nusing an Indian preparation which was a hot water infusion of a root of\ndevil's-club which is a spiny, prickly shrub. This medicine was in\ncommon use by the British Columbia Indians. The material was obtained\nand used in this hospital for the treatment of diabetes and was found\nto be quite as efficient as insulin and had the great advantage that it\nwould be taken by mouth whereas the insulin which is destroyed in the\nstomach by the process of digestion must be injected. They could see\nvery little difference in the efficiency of this preparation whether\ntaken internally or used hypodermically. This promises to be a great\nboon to a large group of individuals suffering from diabetes. It is\nalso probable that its use will prevent the development of diabetes and\nsince the Indians used it for other affections it may also become a\nvery important adjunct in modern preventive medicine.One of the sources that I have found to be helpful in studying\nprimitive races is an investigation of knapsacks. I have asked for the\nprivilege of seeing what is carried in their knapsacks. I found dried\nfish eggs and dried kelp in the knapsacks in the high Andes. It is also\nof interest that among this group in the Andes, among those in central\nAfrica, and among the Aborigines of Australia, each knapsack contained\na ball of clay, a little of which was dissolved in water. Into this\nthey dipped their morsels of food while eating. Their explanation was\nto prevent \"sick stomach.\" This is the medicine that is used by the\nnative in these countries for combating dysentery and food infections.\nIt is the treatment that was given me when I developed dysentery\ninfection in central Africa while making studies there. The English\ndoctor in Nairobi whom I called in said he would give me the native\ntreatment of a suspension of clay. It proved very effective. An\nillustration of the way in which modern science is siowiy adopting\npractices that have been long in use among primitive races, is to be\nfound in the recent extensive use that is made of clay (kaolin) in our\nmodern medicine. This is illustrated in the following:(3)In the course of an expedition to Lake Titicaca,\nSouth America, financed by the Percy Slade Trustees in which one of us\n(H.P.M.) took part, an interesting observation was made in regard to\nthe diet of the Quetchus Indians on the Capachica Peninsula near Puno.\nThese people are almost certainly descendants of the Incas and at the\npresent time live very primitively. They exist largely on a vegetable\ndiet of which potatoes form an important part. Immediately, before\nbeing eaten, the potatoes are dipped into an aqueous suspension of\nclay, a procedure which is said to prevent \"souring of the\nstomach.\"We have examined this clay and found it to\nconsist of kaolin containing a trace of organic material, possibly\ncoumarin, and presumably a decomposition product of the grass from\nunderneath which the clay is dug. The local name for the clay is\nChacco, and the Indians distinguish between good and bad qualities.\nThis dietetic procedure is universal among the Indians of the Puno\ndistrict, and is probably of very ancient origin.Such a practice by a primitive people would\nappear rather remarkable in view of the comparatively recent\nintroduction of kaolin into modern medicine as a protective agent for\nthe gastric and intestinal mucosa and as a remedy for bacterial\ninfections of the gut.It is of interest that both the British and American\nPharmacopeias have added kaolin to their list during the last two\ndecades.The Indians of the past buried, with their dead, foods to carry\nthem on their journey. From an examination of these one learns that in\nmany respects the Indians living in the high Sierras are living today\nvery much as their ancestors did during past centuries. Items of\nimportance now and in the past are parched corn and parched beans which\nare nibbled as the people walk along carrying their heavy burdens.\nToday these are the only foods eaten on many long journeys. We found\nthe parched beans pleasant to taste and very satisfying when we were\nhungry.The Indians of the Amazon Basin have had a history very\ndifferent from either those of the high Sierras of the Andes or those\nof the coastal region. The fact that vast areas of the Amazon Basin\nhave not only never been surveyed, but never even penetrated, indicates\nthe nature of the isolation of these groups. Very little progress has\nbeen made in the effort to conquer or modernize these Indians. A few\nexplorers have made expeditions into parts of the interior and have\nreported the characteristics of the plant and animal life, as well as\nof the native races. Our sole contact was with the tribe which came to\nthe coffee plantation to assist in the gathering and the harvest of the\ncoffee beans. In Chapter 14 I have described these people in\nconsiderable detail. Since the Amazon Basin has vast quantities of rain\nas well as abundant streams from the eastern watershed of the Andes,\nthe tribes live largely in tropical jungles where there is an abundance\nof water. They are expert, accordingly, in the use of river crafts and\nin fishing for the various types of marine life. Unlike the Indians of\nthe high Andes or of the coast regions they are not agriculturists.\nThey live on wild native foods almost entirely. They are expert with\nthe blow gun, with the bow and arrow and in snaring with both nets and\nloops. They use very large quantities of a tuber root called yucca\nwhich has many qualities similar to the roots of the edible variety of\nthe lily family. This plant is boiled and eaten much as are potatoes.\nThey use also large quantities of fish from the streams, birds and\nsmall animals of the land, together with the native fruits including\nbananas. Their dietary provides a very liberal supply of minerals and\nvitamins together with an adequate quantity of carbohydrates, fats and\nproteins.In evaluating the nutritive value of the dietary programs of\nprimitive races and our modernized cultures, it is important that we\nhave a yardstick adequately adjusted to make computation in terms of\nspecific body needs for building good bodies and maintaining them in\ngood health. The advance in modern chemistry has gone far toward making\nthis possible.The problem of estimating the mineral and activator contents, in\nother words the body-building and repairing qualities of the displacing\nfoods used by the various primitive races, is similar in many respects\nto estimating these qualities in the foods used in our modern white\ncivilizations, except that modern commerce has transported usually only\nthe foods that will keep well. These include chiefly white flour,\nsugar, polished rice, vegetable fats and canned goods.Very important data for typical American dietaries are now\navailable provided by the Bureau of Home Economics, United States\nDepartment of Agriculture, and also by the Bureau of Labor Statistics,\nUnited States Department of Labor. These surveys provide a basis of\nestimating the nutrition of various income groups both with regard to\nthe type of foods selected in our American communities and the\nquantities of each type used, together with the chemical content of\nthese foods expressed quantitatively. Those who wish to have detailed\nreports are referred to the bulletins of the above departments. In my\nclinical studies of the mineral constituents of individuals, affected\nwith dental caries and other disturbances of physical deficiency, I\nfind a wide range of variation in the calcium, phosphorus and\nfat-soluble activator content of the dietaries used, although in\ngeneral the calorie content is adequate. This latter factor is\ncontrolled by appetite. These computations reveal that the individuals\nstudied have a calcium intake ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 grams; and a\nphosphorus intake of from 0.3 to 0.6 grams. The minimum adult\nrequirements as provided by such an authority as Sherman, whose figures\nare used by the United States Department of Labor, are for the average\nadult 0.68 of a gram of calcium and 1.32 grams of phosphorus per day.\nIt can be seen readily that the amounts given above are far short of\nthe minimum even if individuals absorbed from the foods all of the\nminerals present. A question arises at this point as to the efficiency\nof the human body in removing all of the minerals from the ingested\nfoods. Extensive laboratory determinations have shown that most people\ncannot absorb more than half of the calcium and phosphorus from the\nfoods eaten. The amounts utilized depend directly on the presence of\nother substances, particularly fat-soluble vitamins. It is at this\npoint probably that the greatest breakdown in our modern diet takes\nplace, namely, in the ingestion and utilization of adequate amounts of\nthe special activating substances, including the vitamins needed for\nrendering the minerals in the food available to the human system. A\nrecent report by the Council on Foods of the American Medical(4)Association makes this comment on spinach:Spinach may be regarded as a rich source of\nvitamin A and as a contributor of vitamin C, iron and roughage to the\ndiet. It is therefore a valuable food. (But) the iron is not well\nutilized by infants . . . (and) the feeding of spinach is of no value\nduring early infancy as a source of calcium.Even though calcium is present in spinach children cannot utilize\nit. Data have been published showing that children absorb very little\nof the calcium or phosphorus in spinach before six years of age. Adult\nindividuals vary in the efficiency with which they absorb minerals and\nother chemicals essential for mineral utilization. It is possible to\nstarve for minerals that are abundant in the foods eaten because they\ncannot be utilized without an adequate quantity of the fat-soluble\nactivators.FIG. 93. This figure shows the\nrapid healing of a fractured femur of a boy four and onehalf years of\nage suffering from convulsions due to malnutrition. His fracture\noccurred when he fell in a convulsion. There was no healing in sixty\ndays. After reinforcing his nutrition with butter vitamins the healing\nat the right occurred in thirty days. Whole milk replaced skim milk and\na whole wheat gruel made from freshly ground whole wheat replaced white\nbread.This is illustrated in the following case. A minister in an\nindustrial section of our city, during the period of severe depression,\ntelephoned me stating that he had just been called to baptize a dying\nchild. The child was not dead although almost constantly in\nconvulsions. He thought the condition was probably nutritional and\nasked if he could bring the boy to the office immediately. The boy was\nbadly emaciated, had rampant tooth decay, one leg in a cast, a very bad\nbronchial cough and was in and out of convulsions in rapid succession.\nHis convulsions had been getting worse progressively during the past\neight months. His leg had been fractured two or three months previously\nwhile walking across the room when he fell in one of his convulsions.\nNo healing had occurred. His diet consisted of white bread and skimmed\nmilk. For mending the fracture the boy needed minerals, calcium,\nphosphorus and magnesium. His convulsions were due to a low calcium\ncontent of the blood. All of these were in the skimmed milk for the\nbutter-fat removed in the cream contains no calcium nor phosphorus,\nexcept traces. The program provided was a change from the white flour\nbread to wheat gruel made from freshly ground wheat and the\nsubstitution of whole milk for skimmed milk, with the addition of about\na teaspoonful of a very high vitamin butter with each feeding. He was\ngiven this meal that evening when he returned to his home. He slept all\nnight without a convulsion. He was fed the same food five times the\nnext day and did not have a convulsion. He proceeded rapidly to regain\nhis health without recurrence of his convulsions. In a month the\nfracture was united. Two views of the fracture are shown in Fig. 93,\none before and one after the treatment. Six weeks after this\nnutritional program was started the preacher called at the home to see\nhow the boy was getting along. His mother stated that the boy was\nplaying about the doorstep, but they could not see him. She called but\nreceived no answer. Presently they spied him where he had climbed up\nthe downspout of the house to the second story. On being scolded by his\nmother, he ran and jumped over the garden fence, thus demonstrating\nthat he was pretty much of a normal boy. This boy's imperative need,\nthat was not provided in white bread and skimmed milk, was the presence\nof the vitamins and other activators that are in whole milk but not in\nskimmed milk, and in whole wheat, freshly ground, but not in white\nflour. He was restored to health by the simple process of having\nNature's natural foods restored to him.This problem of borrowing from the skeleton in times of stress\nmay soften the bones so that they will be badly distorted. This is\nfrequently seen as bow legs. An illustration of an extreme condition of\nbone softening by this process is shown in Fig. 94, lower section,\nwhich is the skeleton of a monkey that was a house pet. It became very\nfond of sweets and was fed on white bread, sweetened jams, etc., as it\nate at the same table with its mistress. Note that the bones became so\nsoft that the pull of the muscles distorted them into all sorts of\ncurves. Naturally its body and legs were seriously distorted. In this\ncondition my patient, whom I was serving professionally, asked me for\nadvice regarding her monkey's deformed legs and distorted body. I\nsuggested an improved nutrition and provided fat-soluble vitamins\nconsisting of a mixture of a high vitamin butter oil and high vitamin\ncod liver oil with the result that minerals were deposited on the\nborders of the vertebrae and joints and on the surfaces of the bones as\nshown in the illustration. This of course, could not correct the\ndeformity and the animal was chloroformed.FIG. 94. This boy, age 5, had\nsuffered for two and one-half years from inflammatory rheumatism,\narthritis and heart involvement. Upper left shows limit of movement of\nneck, left wrist, swollen knees and ankles. The middle upper view shows\nthe change in six months after improvement of his nutrition, and at\nright his change in one year. Below is shown the grossly demineralized\nand deformed skeleton of a pet monkey being fed on sweets and\npastries.The necessity that the foods selected and used shall provide an\nadequate quantity of fat-soluble activators (including the known\nfatsoluble vitamins) is so imperative and is so important in preventing\na part of our modern degeneration that I shall illustrate its need with\nanother practical case.A mother asked my assistance in planning the nutritional program\nfor her boy. She reported that he was five years of age and that he had\nbeen in bed in hospitals with rheumatic fever, arthritis and an acute\nheart involvement most of the time for the past two and a half years.\nShe had been told that her boy would not recover, so severe were the\ncomplications. As is so generally the case with rheumatic fever and\nendocarditis, this boy was suffering from severe tooth decay. In this\nconnection the American Heart Association has reported that 75 per cent\nof heart involvements begin before ten years of age. My studies have\nshown that in about 95 per cent of these cases there is active tooth\ndecay. The important change that I made in this boy's dietary program\nwas the removal of the white flour products and in their stead the use\nof freshly cracked or ground wheat and oats used with whole milk to\nwhich was added a small amount of specially high vitamin butter\nproduced by cows pasturing on green wheat. Small doses of a\nhigh-vitamin, natural cod liver oil were also added. At this time the\nboy was so badly crippled with arthritis, in his swollen knees, wrists,\nand rigid spine, that he was bedfast and cried by the hour. With the\nimprovement in his nutrition which was the only change made in his\ncare, his acute pain rapidly subsided, his appetite greatly improved,\nhe slept soundly and gained rapidly in weight. In the first view, to\nthe left, in Fig. 94, the boy is shown sitting on the edge of the bed\nat the end of the first month on this program. His joints were still\nbadly swollen and his spine so rigid that he could not rotate his head\nfarther than shown in the picture. In the center view he is shown about\nsix months later, and in the third view, one year later. This occurred\nsix years ago. As I write this a letter has been received from the\nboy's mother. She reports that he is taller and heavier than the\naverage, has a good appetite and sleeps well.In the newer light regarding the cause of rheumatic fever, or\ninflammatory rheumatism (discussed in Chapter 21) there appear to be\nthree underlying causes: a general lowered defense against infection in\nwhich the fat-soluble vitamins play a very important part; minute\nhemorrhages in joint tissues as part of the expression of deficiency of\nvitamin C, a scurvy symptom, and a source of infecting bacteria such as\nstreptococcus. This could be provided by his infected teeth. These\ntypical expressions of modern degeneration could not occur in most of\nthe primitive races studied because of the high factor of safety in the\nminerals and vitamins of their nutrition. It is important to emphasize\nthe changes that were made in our modern dietary program to make this\nboy's nutrition adequate for recovery. Sugars and sweets and white\nflour products were eliminated as far as possible. Freshly ground\ncereals were used for breads and gruels. Bone marrow was included in\nstews. Liver and a liberal supply of whole milk, green vegetables and\nfruits were provided. In addition, he was provided with a butter that\nwas very high in vitamins having been produced by cows fed on a rapidly\ngrowing green grass. The best source for this is a pasturage of wheat\nand rye grass. All green grass in a state of rapid growth is good,\nalthough wheat and rye grass are the best found. Unless hay is\ncarefully dried so as to retain its chlorophyll, which is a precursor\nof vitamin A, the cow cannot synthesize the fat-soluble vitamins.These two practical cases illustrate the fundamental necessity\nthat there shall not only be an adequate quantity of body-building\nminerals present, but also that there shall be an adequate quantity of\nfat-soluble vitamins. Of course, water-soluble vitamins are also\nessential. While I have reduced the diets of the various primitive\nraces studied to definite quantities of mineral and calorie content,\nthese data are so voluminous that it will not be appropriate to include\nthem here. It will be more informative to discuss the ratios of both\nbody-building and repairing material in the several primitive\ndietaries, in comparison with the displacing foods adopted from our\nmodern civilization. The amount of food eaten by an individual is\ncontrolled primarily by the hunger factor which for our modernized\ngroups apparently relates only to need for heat and energy. The\ndietaries adopted have all been built on the basis of the heat and\nenergy requirements of the body for the groups living in the several\ndistricts and under their modes of life. These have been calculated for\nthe principal foods eaten by the various groups. The figures will be\npublished in detail in a more technical report. There are two simple\nways in which these comparisons can be made. One is in terms of normal\nbody requirements; and the other in terms of the ratio between the\nmineral and the vitamin content of the native foods and the displacing\nfoods. If we use as a basis the ability of individuals to remove half\nof the minerals present even though their bodies need more than this,\nwe will be more generous than the average individual's capacity will\njustify. This will require that we double the amount, as specified for\nminimum body use by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of\nLabor Statistics, in their Bulletin R 409, that is, for calcium 0.68\ngrams; for phosphorus 1.32 grams; for iron 0.015 grams. The figures\nthat will be used, therefore, are for twice the above amounts: 1.36\ngrams of calcium; 2.64 grams of phosphorus; 0.030 grams of iron.Few people who have not been in contact with experimental data\non metabolism can appreciate how little of the minerals in the food are\nretained in the body by large numbers of individuals who are in need of\nthese very chemicals. We have seen that infants cannot absorb calcium\nfrom spinach. If we are to provide nutrition that will include an\nadequate excess as a factor of safety for overloads, and for such\nperiods as those of rapid growth (for children), pregnancy, lactation\nand sickness, we must provide the excess to the extent of about twice\nthe requirements of normal adults. It will therefore, be necessary for\nan adequate nutrition to contain approximately four times the minimum\nrequirements of the average adult if all stress periods are to be\npassed safely.It is of interest that the diets of the primitive groups which\nhave shown a very high immunity to dental caries and freedom from other\ndegenerative processes have all provided a nutrition containing at\nleast four times these minimum requirements; whereas the displacing\nnutrition of commerce, consisting largely of white-flour products,\nsugar, polished rice, jams, canned goods, and vegetable fats have\ninvariably failed to provide even the minimum requirements. In other\nwords the foods of the native Eskimos contained 5.4 times as much\ncalcium as the displacing foods of the white man, five times as much\nphosphorus, 1.5 times as much iron, 7.9 times as much magnesium, 1.8\ntimes as much copper, 49.0 times as much iodine, and at least ten times\nthat number of fat-soluble vitamins. For the Indians of the far North\nof Canada, the native foods provided 5.8 times as much calcium, 5.8\ntimes as much phosphorus, 2.7 times as much iron, 4.3 times as much\nmagnesium, 1.5 times as much copper, 8.8 times as much iodine, and at\nleast a ten fold increase in fat-soluble activators. For brevity, we\nwill apply the figures to calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron and\nfat-soluble activators in order. The ratio in the Swiss native diets to\nthat in the displacing diet was for calcium, 3.7 fold; for phosphorus,\n2.2 fold; for magnesium, 2.5 fold; for iron, 3.1 fold; and for the\nfat-soluble activators, at least ten fold. For the Gaelics in the Outer\nHebrides, the native foods provided 2.1 times as much calcium, 2.3\ntimes as much phosphorus, 1.3 times as much magnesium, and 1.0 times as\nmuch iron; and the fat-soluble activators were increased at least ten\nfold. For the Aborigines of Australia, living along the eastern coast\nwhere they have access to sea foods the ratio of minerals in the native\ndiet to those in the displacing modernized foods was, for calcium, 4.6\nfold; for phosphorus, 6.2 fold; for magnesium, 17 fold; and for iron\n50.6 fold; while for the fatsoluble activators, it was at least ten\nfold. The native diet of the New Zealand Maori provided an increase in\nthe native foods over the displacing foods of the modernized whites of\n6.2 fold for calcium, 6.9 fold for phosphorus, 23.4 fold for magnesium,\n58.3 fold for iron; and the fatsoluble activators were increased at\nleast ten fold. The native diet of the Melanesians provided similarly\nan increase over the provision made in the modernized foods which\ndisplaced them of 5.7 fold for calcium, 6.4 fold for phosphorus, 26.4\nfold for magnesium, and 22.4 fold for iron; while the fat-soluble\nactivators were increased at least ten fold. The Polynesians provided\nthrough their native diet for an increase in provision over that of the\ndisplacing imported diets, of 5.6 fold for calcium, 7.2 fold for\nphosphorus, 28.5 fold for magnesium, 18.6 fold for iron; and the\nfat-soluble activators were increased at least ten fold. The coastal\nIndians of Peru provided through their native primitive diets for an\nincrease in provision over that of the displacing modernized diet of\n6.6 fold for calcium, 5.5 fold for phosphorus, 13.6 fold for magnesium,\n5.1 fold for iron; and an excess of ten fold was provided for\nfat-soluble vitamins. For the Indians of the Andean Mountains of Peru,\nthe native foods provided an increase over the provision of the\ndisplacing modern foods of S fold for calcium, 5.5 fold for phosphorus,\n13.3 fold for magnesium, 29.3 fold for iron; and an excess of at least\nten fold was provided for fat-soluble vitamins. For the cattle tribes\nin the interior of Africa, the primitive foods provided an increase\nover the provision of the displacing modernized foods of 7.5 fold for\ncalcium, 8.2 fold for phosphorus, 19.1 fold for magnesium, 16.6 fold\nfor iron and at least ten fold for fat-soluble activators. For the\nagricultural tribes in Central Africa the native diet provided an\nincrease over the provision of the displacing modern diet of 3.5 fold\nfor calcium, 4.1 fold for phosphorus, 5.4 fold for magnesium, 16.6 fold\nfor iron and ten fold for fat-soluble activators. All the above\nprimitive diets provided also a large increase in the water-soluble\nvitamins over the number provided in the displacing modern diets.FIG. 95. Effect of different\nwheat products on rats. Left: whole wheat. Center: white flour. Right:\nbran and middlings mixture. The graphs record actual amount of\nindicated minerals present, as milligrams per cent. Only the rats on\nthe whole wheat developed normally without tooth decay. Those on white\nflour had tooth decay, were underweight, had skin infections and were\nirritable. They did not reproduce. The third group were undersize. The\nbalance of the ration was the same for all.From the data presented in the preceding chapters and in this\ncomparison of the primitive and modernized dietaries it is obvious that\nthere is great need that the grains eaten shall contain all the\nminerals and vitamins which Nature has provided that they carry.\nImportant data might be presented to illustrate this phase in a\npractical way. In Fig. 95 will be seen three rats all of which received\nthe same diet, except for the type of bread. The first rat (at the\nleft) received whole-wheat products freshly ground, the center one\nreceived a white flour product and the third (at the right) a bran and\nmiddlings product. The amounts of each ash, of calcium as the oxide,\nand of phosphorus as the pentoxide; and the amounts of iron and copper\npresent in the diet of each group are shown by the height of the\ncolumns beneath the rats. Clinically it will be seen that there is a\nmarked difference in the physical development Qf these rats. Several\nrats of the same age were in each cage. The feeding was started after\nweaning at about twenty-three days of age. The rat at the left was on\nthe entire grain product. It was fully developed. The rats in this cage\nreproduced normally at three months of age. The rats in this first cage\nhad very mild dispositions and could be picked up by the ear or tail\nwithout danger of their biting. The rats represented by the one in the\ncenter cage using white flour were markedly undersized. Their hair came\nout in large patches and they had very ugly dispositions, so ugly that\nthey threatened to spring through the cage wall at us when we came to\nlook at them. These rats had tooth decay and they were not able to\nreproduce. The rats in the next cage (illustrated by the rat to the\nright) which were on the bran and middlings mixture did not show tooth\ndecay, but were considerably undersized, and they lacked energy. The\nflour and middlings for the rats in cages two and three were purchased\nfrom the miller and hence were not freshly ground. The wheat given to\nthe first group was obtained whole and ground while fresh in a hand\nmill. It is of interest that notwithstanding the great increase in ash,\ncalcium, phosphorus, iron and copper present in the foods of the last\ngroup, the rats did not mature normally, as did those in the first\ngroup. This may have been due in large part to the fact that the\nmaterial was not freshly ground, and as a result they could not obtain\na normal vitamin content from the embryo of the grain due to its\noxidation. This is further indicated by the fact that the rats in this\ngroup did not reproduce, probably due in considerable part to a lack of\nvitamins B and E which were lost by oxidation of the embryo or germ\nfat.There is a misapprehension with regard to the possibility that\nhumans may obtain enough of the vitamin D group of activators from our\nmodern plant foods or from sunshine. This is due to the belief\nviosterol or similar products by other names, derived by exposing\nergosterol to ultraviolet light, offer all of the nutritional factors\ninvolved in the vitamin D group. I have emphasized that there are known\nto be at least eight D factors that have been definitely isolated and\ntwelve that have been reported as partially isolated.Coffin has recently reported relative to the lack of vitamin D\nin common foods as follows:(5)A representative list of common foods was carefully\ntested, by approved technique, for their vitamin D content.With the remote possibility of egg yolks, butter,\ncream, liver and fish it is manifestly impossible to obtain any amount\nof vitamin D worthy of mention from common foods.Vegetables do not contain vitamin D.It will be noted that vitamin D, which the human does not readily\nsynthesize in adequate amounts, must be provided by foods of animal\ntissues or animal products. As yet I have not found a single group of\nprimitive racial stock which was building and maintaining excellent\nbodies by living entirely on plant foods. I have found in many parts of\nthe world most devout representatives of modern ethical systems\nadvocating the restriction of foods to the vegetable products. In every\ninstance where the groups involved had been long under this teaching, I\nfound evidence of degeneration in the form of dental caries, and in the\nnew generation in the form of abnormal dental arches to an extent very\nmuch higher than in the primitive groups who were not under this\ninfluence.Many illustrations might be presented showing the special wisdom\nof the primitives in the matter of reinforcing their nutrition with\nprotective foods.Few people will realize how reluctant members of the primitive\nraces are, in general, to disclose secrets of their race. The need for\nthis is comparable to the need for secrecy regarding modern war\ndevices.The Indians of the Yukon have long known the cure for scurvy and\nhistory makes an important contribution to their wisdom in treating\nthis disease. It is of interest that W. N. Kemp(6)of Vancouver states:The earliest recorded successful treatment of\nscurvy occurred in Canada in 1535 when Jacques Cartier, on the advice\nof a friendly Indian, gave his scurvyprostrated men a decoction of\nyoung green succulent 'shoots' from the spruce trees with successful\nresults. These happy effects apparently were not appreciated in Europe,\nfor scurvy continued to be endemic.Since that time untold thousands of mariners and white land\ndwellers have died with this dreaded disease.Shortly before our arrival in Northern Canada a white prospector\nhad died of scurvy. Beside him was his white man's packet of canned\nfoods. Any Indian man or woman, boy or girl, could have told him how to\nsave his life by eating animal organs or the buds of trees.Another illustration of the wisdom of the native Indians of that\nfar north country came to me through two prospectors whom we rescued\nand brought out with us just before the fall freeze-up. They had gone\ninto the district, which at that time was still uncharted and\nunsurveyed, to prospect for precious metals and radium. They were both\ndoctors of engineering and science, and had been sent with very\nelaborate equipment from one of the large national mining corporations.\nOwing to the inaccessibility of the region, they adopted a plan for\nreaching it quickly. They had flown across the two ranges of mountains\nfrom Alaska and when they arrived at the inside range, i.e., the Rocky\nMountain Range, they found the altitude so high that their plane could\nnot fly over the range, and, as a result, they were brought down on a\nlittle lake outside. The plane then returned but was unable to reach\nthe outside world because of shortage of fuel. The pilot had to leave\nit on a waterway and trudge over the mountains to civilization. The two\nprospectors undertook to carry their equipment and provisions over the\nRocky Mountain Range into the interior district where they were to\nprospect. They found the distance across the plateau to be about one\nhundred miles and the elevation ranging up to nine thousand feet. While\nthey had provisions and equipment to stay two years they found it would\ntake all of this time to carry their provisions and instruments across\nthis plateau. They accordingly abandoned everything, and rather than\nremain in the country with very uncertain facilities and prospects for\nobtaining food and shelter, made a forced march to the Liard River with\nthe hope that some expedition might be in that territory. One of the\nmen told me the following tragic story. While they were crossing the\nhigh plateau he nearly went blind with so violent a pain in his eyes\nthat he feared he would go insane. It was not snow blindness, for they\nwere equipped with glasses. It was xeropthalmia, due to lack of vitamin\nA. One day he almost ran into a mother grizzly bear and her two cubs.\nFortunately, they did not attack him but moved off. He sat down on a\nstone and wept in despair of ever seeing his family again. As he sat\nthere holding his throbbing head, he heard a voice and looked up. It\nwas an old Indian who had been tracking that grizzly bear. He\nrecognized this prospector's plight and while neither could understand\nthe language of the other, the Indian after making an examination of\nhis eyes, took him by the hand and led him to a stream that was\ncoursing its way down the mountain. Here as the prospector sat waiting\nthe Indian built a trap of stones across the stream. He then went\nupstream and waded down splashing as he came and thus drove the trout\ninto the trap. He threw the fish out on the bank and told the\nprospector to eat the flesh of the head and the tissues back of the\neyes, including the eyes, with the result that in a few hours his pain\nhad largely subsided. In one day his sight was rapidly returning, and\nin two days his eyes were nearly normal. He told me with profound\nemotion and gratitude that that Indian had certainly saved his\nlife.Now modern science knows that one of the richest sources of\nvitamin A in the entire animal body is that of the tissues back of the\neyes including the retina of the eye.In Chapter 18 I refer to the work of Wald on studies of vitamin\nA tissues. He states that extracts of eye tissue (retina, pigment,\nepithelium, and choroid) show the characteristic vitamin A absorption\nband and that they are potent in curing vitamin A deficient rats. He\nshows also that the concentration of vitamin A is constant for\ndifferent mammals.I have been impressed to find that primitive racial stocks in\nvarious parts of the world are familiar with the fact that eyes\nconstitute an invaluable adjunct for nutrition. Even the one time\ncannibals of the Fiji Islands, and the hereditary king of the Fiji\nIslands, told me in detail of the practices with regard to the use of\neyes as an adjunct to diet. The chief, his father, and grandfather had\nthe privilege of reserving the eyes of captives for their personal use.\nWhen among the natives of the islands north of Australia, I learned to\nenjoy greatly fish head soup made from certain selected tissues. After\nthe fish had been cleaned the heads were split and the eyes left\nin.The space of the entire book might be used for discussing the\nnutritional wisdom of the various primitive races. It is a pity that so\nmuch of their wisdom has been lost through lack of appreciation by the\nwhites who early made contact with them.REFERENCESSHERMAN, H. C. Chemistry of Foods and Nutrition.

We are concerned now with discovering whether\nthe use of foods, which are equivalent in body-building and repairing\nmaterial to those used by the primitives will, when provided to our\naffected modernized groups, prevent tooth decay or check it when it is\nactive.There are two approaches to this problem of the control of tooth\ndecay by nutritional means. One is by the presentation of clinical\nresults and the other by the consideration of the characteristics of\nthose nutritional programs which have been successful in producing a\nhigh immunity to tooth decay.We may divide the primitive racial stocks into groups, classified\naccording to the physical environment in which they are living and the\nmanner in which the environment largely controls their available foods.\nIt is significant that I have as yet found no group that was building\nand maintaining good bodies exclusively on plant foods. A number of\ngroups are endeavoring to do so with marked evidence of failure. The\nvariety of animal foods available has varied widely in some groups, and\nbeen limited among others.In the preceding chapter we have seen that the successful\ndietaries included in addition to a liberal source of minerals,\ncarbohydrates, fats, proteins, and water-soluble vitamins, a source of\nfat-soluble vitamins.Vitamin D is not found in plants, but must be sought in an animal\nfood. The dietaries of the efficient primitive racial stocks may be\ndivided into groups on this basis: in the first place those obtaining\ntheir fatsoluble activators, which include the known fat-soluble\nvitamins, from efficient dairy products. This includes the Swiss in the\nhigh Alps, the Arabs (using camel's milk), and the Asiatic races (using\nmilk of sheep and musk ox). In the second place there are those using\nliberally the organs of animals, and the eggs of birds, wild and\ndomesticated. These include the Indians of the far North, the buffalo\nhunting Plains Indians and the Andean tribes. In the third place there\nare those using liberally animal life of the sea. These include Pacific\nIslanders and coastal tribes throughout the world. In the fourth place\nthere are those using small animals and insects. These include the\nAustralian Aborigines in the interior, and the African tribes in the\ninterior.Many of the above groups use foods from two or more sources. Each\nof the groups has provided an adequate quantity of body-building\nmaterial from both animal and plant tissues. It does not matter what\nthe source of minerals and vitamins may be so long as the supply is\nadequate. In our modern life, the location of a group will determine\nthe most efficient and most convenient source for obtaining the\nessential foods. Clearly, for those near the coast, the sea may be most\nconvenient, while for those in the interior or in the far North, dairy\nproducts or the organs of animals may be the only available source. It\nwould be fortunate indeed, if our problems were as simple as this\nstatement might indicate. We have, however, in the first place, the\nneed for a strength of character and will power such as will make us\nuse the things our bodies require rather than only the foods we like.\nAnother problem arises from the fact that our modern sedentary lives\ncall for so little energy that many people will not eat enough even of\na good food to provide for both growth and repair, since hunger appeals\nare for energy only, the source of heat and power, and not for\nbody-building minerals and other chemicals. Still another problem\nconfronts us, i.e., the sources of fatsoluble activators indicated\nabove, namely: dairy products, organs of animals and sea foods, may\nvary through a wide range in their content of the fat-soluble\nactivators or vitamins, depending upon the nutrition available for the\nanimals. Cows fed on third grade hay, too low in carotene, not only\ncannot produce strong calves but their milk will not keep healthy\ncalves alive. (Chapter 18.)The League of Nations' Committee on Nutrition has estimated the\namount of pasture land required per capita to provide adequate milk and\nmeat. Owing to the density of population and cost of land near large\ncities, it is not possible to provide an adequate acreage for dairy\ncattle. This results in stall feeding of shipped fodder. Only those\ncows can be kept in a herd whose production of milk and butter fat can\npay in volume for their keep. Unfortunately milk may have a high cream\nline or butter fat content and still be low in essential fat-soluble\nvitamins. This constitutes an exceedingly important phase of our modern\nproblem. Butter ships best when hard and this quality can be largely\ncontrolled by the fodder given to the cattle and hence becomes an\nimportant factor in the wholesale butter industry. Since 1927, I have\nbeen analyzing samples of dairy products, chiefly butter, from several\nparts of the world for their vitamin content. These samples are\nreceived every two to four weeks from the same places, usually for\nseveral years. They all show a seasonal rise and fall in vitamin\ncontent. The high level is always associated with the use of rapidly\ngrowing young plant food. This tide in plant life, fluctuating with the\nseasons, controlled the migration of the buffalo southward in the\nautumn and winter and northward in the spring. They moved at the rate\nof about twelve miles per day, travelling with the sun in order to\nprovide the highest-vitamin milk for the young calves born in the\nsouth. No doubt these tides in nutrition control also the migration of\nbirds. By far the most efficient plant food that I have found for\nproducing the high-vitamin content in milk is rapidly growing young\nwheat and rye grass. Oat and barley grass are also excellent. In my\nclinical work small additions of this high-vitamin butter to otherwise\nsatisfactory diets regularly checks tooth decay when active and at the\nsame time improves vitality and general health.Similarly the value of eggs for providing fat-soluble vitamins\ndepends directly upon the food eaten by the fowl. The fertility of the\neggs also is a direct measure of the vitamin content, including vitamin\nE.Since the sea foods are, as a group, so valuable a source of the\nfatsoluble activators, they have been found to be efficient throughout\nthe world not only for controlling tooth decay, but for producing a\nhuman stock of high vitality. Unfortunately the cost of transportation\nin the fresh state often constitutes a factor limiting distribution.\nMany of the primitive races preserved the food value, including\nvitamins, very efficiently by drying the fish. While our modern system\nof canning prevents decomposition, it does not efficiently preserve\nsome of the fatsoluble activators, particularly vitamin A.Since the organs, particularly the livers of animals, are storage\ndepots of the vitamins an important source of some of the fat-soluble\nactivators can be provided by extracting the fat of the livers and\nshipping it as liver oils. Modern methods of processing have greatly\nimproved the quality of these oils. There are some factors, however,\nwhich can be provided to great advantage for humans from dairy products\nof high efficiency.I have shown in the preceding chapter the quantities of several\nof the minerals that are essential in suitable chemical form to\nmaintain an adult in good health and make possible tissue repair. The\ndietaries of the various primitive groups have all been shown to have a\nmineral content several times higher than that which obtains in the\ninadequate food eaten by modernized primitives and the people of our\nmodernized cultures.Modern commerce has deliberately robbed some of nature's foods of\nmuch of their body-building material while retaining the hunger\nsatisfying energy factors. For example, in the production of refined\nwhite flour approximately eighty per cent or four-fifths of the\nphosphorus and calcium content are usually removed, together with the\nvitamins and minerals provided in the embryo or germ. The evidence\nindicates that a very important factor in the lowering of reproductive\nefficiency of womanhood is directly related to the removal of vitamin E\nin the processing of wheat. The germ of wheat is our most readily\navailable source of that vitamin. Its role as a nutritive factor for\nthe pituitary gland in the base of the brain, which largely controls\ngrowth and organ function, apparently is important in determining the\nproduction of mental types. Similarly the removal of vitamin B with the\nembryo of the wheat, together with its oxidation after processing,\nresults in depletion of body-building activators.Refined white sugar carries only negligible traces of\nbody-building and repairing material. It satisfies hunger by providing\nheat and energy besides having a pleasant flavor. The heat and energy\nproducing factors in our food that are not burned up are usually stored\nas fat. In the preceding chapter we have seen that approximately half\nof the foods provided in our modern dietaries furnish little or no\nbody-building or repairing material and supply no vitamins.\nApproximately 25 per cent of the heat and energy of the American people\nis supplied by sugar alone which goes far in thwarting Nature's orderly\nprocesses of life. This per capita use is unfortunately on the\nincrease. Therefore we must begin by radically reducing the foods that\nare so deceptive, and often injurious in overloading the system. Even\nthis much change in our modern nutrition will raise the factor of\nsafety sufficiently to check tooth decay in a large percentage of\npeople. It will not, however, be adequate for most children in whom the\nadditional demands of rapid growth must be satisfied. I have found the\nhighest incidence of tooth decay in the high school and boarding school\ngirls, and the next in the boarding school boys. These groups suffer\neven more than the childbearing mothers.In discussing the technical aspects later I shall consider the\ndefensive factors in the saliva as controlled by the nutrition through\nthe blood stream, and also the role of oral prophylaxis.It is appropriate at this point to note some characteristics of a\ndecaying tooth. The process of tooth decay never starts from within but\nalways from without and is most likely to start at the contact points\nbetween the teeth or in the pits and grooves, especially when these are\nincompletely formed. Teeth never have caries while they are covered\nwith flesh but decay most easily soon after eruption, when conditions\nare unfavorable. If the saliva is normal the surfaces of the teeth\nprogressively harden during the first year after eruption. While there\nare many theories regarding the relative importance of different\nfactors in the process of decay practically all provide for a local\nsolution of the tooth substance by acids produced by bacteria. The\nessential difference in the various theories of tooth decay is the\ndifference in theories relative to the control of these decalcifying\norganisms, and relative to their quantity and activity. The dental\nprofession has been waiting for decades for this question to be solved\nbefore taking active steps to prevent the whole process. The primitive\napproach has been to provide a program that will keep the teeth well,\nthat is, prevention of dental caries by adequate food combinations. I\nhave just stated that teeth harden after eruption if the saliva is\nnormal. This occurs by a process of mineralization much like the\nprocess by which petrified wood is produced.The tooth is made up of four structures. The first is the pulp\nwithin, which carries blood vessels and nerves. This structure is\nsurrounded in both the root and crown by the dentine or tooth bone\nwhich is nourished from within. The dentine of the root is covered by\ncementum which receives nourishment from the membrane which attaches\nthe root to the jaw bone. The dentine of the crown or exposed part of\nthe tooth is covered with enamel. Tooth decay proceeds slowly through\nthe enamel and often rapidly in the dentine, always following the\nminute channels toward the pulp, which may become infected before the\ndecay actually reaches the pulp to expose it; nearly always the decay\ninfects the pulp when it destroys the dentine covering it. When a tooth\nhas a deep cavity of decay, the decalcified dentine has about the\ndensity of rotten wood. With an adequate improvement in nutrition,\ntooth decay will generally be checked provided two conditions are\npresent: in the first place, there must be enough improvement in the\nquality of the saliva; and in the second, the saliva must have free\naccess to the cavity. Of course, if the decay is removed and a filling\nplaced in the cavity, the bacteria will be mechanically shut out. One\nof the most severe tests of a nutritional program, accordingly, is the\ntest of its power to check tooth decay completely, even without\nfillings. There are, however, two further tests of the sufficiency of\nimprovement of the chemical content of the saliva. If it has been\nsufficiently improved, bacterial growth will not only be inhibited, but\nthe leathery decayed dentine will become mineralized from the saliva by\na process similar to petrification. Note that this mineralized dentine\nis not vital, nor does it increase in volume and fill the cavity. When\nscraped with a steel instrument it frequently takes on a density like\nvery hard wood and occasionally takes even a glassy surface. When such\na tooth is placed in silver nitrate, the chemical does not penetrate\nthis demineralized dentine, though it does rapidly penetrate the\ndecayed dentine of a tooth extracted when decay is active. This process\nis illustrated in Fig. 96 which shows two deciduous teeth extracted\nfrom the same child, one before, and the other a few months after\nimproving the nutrition. These deciduous molars were replaced by the\nbicuspids of the second dentition. The tooth at the left had deep\ncaries and was removed before the treatment was begun. Note that the\nsilver nitrate has blackened the tissue to the depth of the decay. The\ntooth at the right was removed about three months after the nutrition\nwas changed. Note that the decayed dentine is so dense that the silver\nnitrate has not penetrated deeply and discolored it.FIG. 96. A, illustrates the\npermeability of decayed dentin to silver nitrate. B, illustrates the\ndecreased permeability of decayed dentin to silver nitrate due to\nmineralization, after saliva has been improved by correcting the\nnutrition.There is still another test that demonstrates Nature's protective\nmechanisms. Ordinarily, when the pulp of a tooth is exposed by dental\ncaries, the pulp becomes not only infected, but dies opening up a\nhighway of infection direct from the infected mouth to the inside of\nthe fort at the end of the root. One expression of this is a dental\nabscess, the existence of which is usually unknown to the individual\nfor sometime and the infecting germs pass more or less freely\nthroughout the body by way of the blood stream and lymph channels. This\ninfection may start the degeneration of organs and tissues of other\nparts of the body.Among some of the primitive races, whose nutritional programs\nprovided a very high factor of safety, even though the teeth were worn\ndown to the gum line and into what was formerly the pulp chamber, the\npulp was not exposed. Nature had built a protecting zone, not in the\ncavity of the tooth in this case, but within the pulp chamber. This\nentirely blocked off a threatened exposure and kept the walls of the\nfort sealed against bacteria. This process does not occur in many\ninstances in people of our modern civilization. Pulp chambers that are\nopened by wear provide exposed pulp which becomes infected with\nsubsequent abscess formation. If a reinforced nutrition as efficient as\nthat of many of the primitive races, is adopted, the pulp tissue will\nseal up the opening made by decalcification of the dentine, by building\nin a new layer of normal dentine which is vital and quite unlike the\npetrified decay exposed to the saliva, thus completely walling off the\nimpending danger. This is illustrated in Fig. 97 with three cases. At\nthe left are shown x-rays of teeth of three children in one of my\nexperimental clinics in a poor district in Cleveland. The pulp chambers\nand pulp tissues of the root canals are shown as dark streaks in the\ncenter of the tooth. The very large cavities which had decalcified the\ntooth to the pulp chamber are shown as large dark areas in the crown.\nTemporary fillings had to be placed because of pain produced by the\npressure of food on the pulp below the decayed dentine. After the\nnutrition was improved, the tissues of the pulp built in secondary\ndentine thus reincasing itself in a closed chamber. This process is\nshown in each of the three cases presented in Fig. 97, in the views to\nthe right.FIG. 97. Three cases that\nillustrate how nature can close an exposure of the pulp due to dental\ncaries by building a protecting wall within the pulp chamber when the\nnutrition is adequately improved.Under the stress of the industrial depression the family dietary\nof the children shown in Fig. 97 was very deficient. They were brought\nto a mission where we fed them one reinforced meal at noon for six days\na week. The home meals were not changed nor the home care of the teeth.\nThe preliminary studies of each child included complete x-rays of all\nof the teeth, a chemical analysis of the saliva, a careful plotting of\nthe position, size and depth of all cavities, a record of the height,\nand weight, and a record of school grades, including grades in\ndeportment. These checks were repeated every four to six weeks for the\nperiod of the test, usually three to five months. It is important to\nnote that the home nutrition which had been responsible for the tooth\ndecay was exceedingly low in body building and repairing material,\nwhile temporarily satisfying the appetite. It usually consisted of\nhighly sweetened strong coffee and white bread, vegetable fat, pancakes\nmade of white flour and eaten with syrup, and doughnuts fried in\nvegetable fat.The nutrition provided these children in this one meal included\nthe following foods. About four ounces of tomato juice or orange juice\nand a teaspoonful of a mixture of equal parts of a very high vitamin\nnatural cod liver oil and an especially high vitamin butter was given\nat the beginning of the meal. They then received a bowl containing\napproximately a pint of a very rich vegetable and meat stew, made\nlargely from bone marrow and fine cuts of tender meat: the meat was\nusually broiled separately to retain its juice and then chopped very\nfine and added to the bone marrow meat soup which always contained\nfinely chopped vegetables and plenty of very yellow carrots; for the\nnext course they had cooked fruit, with very little sweetening, and\nrolls made from freshly ground whole wheat, which were spread with the\nhigh-vitamin butter. The wheat for the rolls was ground fresh every day\nin a motor driven coffee mill. Each child was also given two glasses of\nfresh whole milk. The menu was varied from day to day by substituting\nfor the meat stew, fish chowder or organs of animals. From time to\ntime, there was placed in a two quart jar a helping similar to that\neaten by the children. This was brought to my laboratory for chemical\nanalysis, which analysis showed that these meals provided approximately\n1.48 grams of calcium and 1.28 grams of phosphorus in a single helping\nof each course. Since many of the children doubled up on the course,\ntheir intake of these minerals was much higher. I have shown in the\npreceding chapter that the accepted figures for the requirements of the\nbody for calcium and phosphorus are 0.68 grams of calcium and 1.32\ngrams of phosphorus. It is obvious that this one meal a day plus the\nother two meals at home provided a real factor of safety. Clinically\nthis program completely controlled the dental caries of each member of\nthe group.The chemical analysis of the saliva(1, 2)revealed a marked improvement which progressively increased. At the\nbeginning of the test the average for the group showed a very low\nfactor of safety, so low that we should expect tooth decay to be\nactive. In six weeks the average changed to a condition which we should\nexpect would be accompanied by a cessation of tooth decay. The saliva\nfactor of safety continued to improve for five months at which time the\nspecial program was discontinued for the summer.Several incidents of special interest occurred. Two different\nteachers came to me to inquire what had been done to make a particular\nchild change from one of the poorest in the class in capacity to learn\nto one of the best. Dental caries is only one of the many expressions\nof our modern deficient nutritions.I have referred to the importance of a high vitamin butter for\nproviding the fat-soluble activators to make possible the utilization\nof the minerals in the foods. In this connection, it is of interest\nthat butter constitutes the principal source of these essential factors\nfor many primitive groups throughout the world. In the high mountain\nand plateau district in northern India, and in Tibet, the inhabitants\ndepend largely upon butter made from the milk of the musk ox and the\nsheep for these activators. The butter is eaten mixed with roasted\ncereals, is used in tea, and in a porridge made of tea, butter and\nroasted grains. In Sudan Egypt, I found considerable traffic in high\nvitamin butter which came from the higher lands a few miles from the\nNile Basin. This was being exchanged for and used with varieties of\nmillet grown in other districts. This butter, at the temperature of\nthat area, which ranged from 90° to 110° Fahrenheit, was, of\ncourse, always in liquid form. Its brilliant orange color testified to\nthe splendid pasture of the dairy animals. The people in Sudan,\nincluding the Arabs, had exceptionally fine teeth with exceedingly\nlittle tooth decay (Chapter 9). The most physically perfect people in\nnorthern India are probably the Pathans who live on dairy products\nlargely in the form of soured curd, together with wheat and vegetables.\nThe people are very tall and are free of tooth decay.Probably every housewife is familiar with the low melting quality\nof the butter produced in early summer when the cows have been put on\nthe green pastures. This is particularly true of butter that has the\ngrassy flavor and the deep yellow to orange color. This butter is\nusually several times as high in fat-soluble activators including\nvitamins A and D as butter produced from stall fed cattle or cattle on\npoorer pasturage. In Chapter 15, I have explained why this butter is\nnot favorable for shipping and why dairymen so frequently give the cows\na ration that will produce less of these qualities. One of the\nprincipal foods used for accomplishing this is made of cotton seed meal\nand cereals.There are many illustrations of the low efficiency of this type\nof fodder for providing vitamins essential for dairy products. In one\nof the recent severe droughts in the Mississippi Valley several\nthousand cattle were shipped to Ohio for water and green pasture as a\nmeans of saving their lives. They were fed enroute on concentrates said\nto consist of cotton seed meal and grain. Professor Oscar Erf of the\nDepartment of Dairying of Ohio State University has given me the\nfollowing detailed information:With reference to the cattle from the\nsouth-western and central-northern states of the drought area which\nwere brought into Ohio in the fall of 1935 on a 600 acre farm north of\nDelaware, will say that I had the privilege of viewing some of these\ncattle previous to the time that they were brought to Ohio in 1935.\nBecause of the extreme drought period and the hot sun, it was rare to\nsee green grass on the prairies. The sedges were nearly all dried up.\nThe tumbleweed was about the only thing that was available for the\ncattle in some instances. The corn was dried up and very little green\nwas in evidence. In the particular location that I was in we found the\ncattle suffering terribly. Many had infected eyes.There were a good many deaths on the plains which\nwere literally dried up. Sometimes there was even a small amount of\ndecomposition after death. In the fall, those that survived on the\nplains, were loaded up and driven to the corrals, loaded into cars and\nsent east. Only the good ones were loaded and even a large number of\nthese passed out in transit.I was informed that the crop of grass the year\nbefore was very scant. Consequently, a large number of calves were born\nwith weak eyes and these were the early ones to pass out on the plains.\nThe low vitality of the individuals which I considered was due to the\nlack of vitamin A or the green grass factors was the cause of the\nserious infection, however their being secondary to the primary\ncause.The first train load of the twenty-eight hundred\ncattle that were brought to this ranch were fed on green corn stalks.\nThere was a nine acre patch of corn in this area. The fences were taken\ndown one afternoon at 3 o'clock and by 9 o'clock there was no evidence\nof stubbles or roots. This had all been eaten in a very short space of\ntime. We had quite a time getting hays and green stuff which we\ndemanded because of its carotin content and its green grass factor.\nThere was not enough grass available in the beginning so we had to buy\nabout 400 tons of hay a day to keep the animals fed. They got no grain\nof any kind because it was a question of bringing the cattle to a more\nor less normal condition with no intention of fattening the\nanimals.After they had made arrangements for feeding\noperations and made feed racks in sufficient numbers, we went over the\nherd to estimate the numbers that were blind and had sore eyes, which I\nassume from past experience, was due to a vitamin A deficiency. As near\nas we can estimate, nearly 8 12 animals were affected (29 per cent).\nThere were 157 calves born and approximately 50 per cent were deformed\nand not normal. We did not get the complete figures but they probably\nranged a little higher than that. The worst infected cows were calves\nand animals that were 18 to 20 months old. I could not get the story of\nthese individuals but they must have been in the area of dry grass for\n2 years. There was a slight improvement in those that were not\nseriously infected after they were fed here. They improved decidedly in\nOctober and November and were practically all slaughtered before the\nmiddle of December.The milk of these vitamin deficient cows would not properly nourish\neither their calves or human beings.Many children have tooth decay even while using whole milk, in\npart because the milk is too low in vitamin content, due to the\ninadequacy of the food given the cows. The means for improving this\ncondition have been discussed in Chapter 15.Some of the current theories of the chemistry of tooth decay\nplace the responsibility on the local condition in the mouth as\naffected by the contributing factors provided by sugars and starches\nwhich enhance the growth of acid producing organisms. A phase of this\nhas been closely related to the slogan that a clean tooth cannot decay.\nAmong the difficulties in applying this interpretation is the physical\nimpossibility of keeping teeth bacteriologically clean in the\nenvironment of the mouth. Another difficulty is the fact that many\nprimitive races have their teeth smeared with starchy foods almost\nconstantly and make no effort whatsoever to clean their teeth. In spite\nof this they have no tooth decay. In many of the primitive groups that\nI have studied the process of modernization includes teaching oral\nhygiene and prophylaxis. Yet, even with the addition of this important\nadjunct to health, they have in most cases lost their immunity to tooth\ndecay and dental caries has become active. This will be seen in many of\nthe illustrations of the primitive races in the preceding chapters. Of\ncourse everyone should clean his teeth, even the primitives, in the\ninterest of and out of consideration for others.In my clinical work I have sought for extreme cases of active\ntooth decay in order to test the primitive wisdom. Many of these cases\nhave been furnished by members of the dental profession in other cities\nand states. By the simple procedure of studying the nutrition of the\nindividual, obtaining a sample of saliva for analysis, seeing x-rays of\nthe individual's teeth and supporting bone, and getting a history of\nthe systemic overloads, I have been able to outline a nutritional\nprogram which, in well above 90 per cent of the cases has controlled\nthe dental caries. Improvement in the condition of the teeth has been\nconfirmed by later x-rays and reports by the patients' dentists. In a\nfew cases where I had contact with the patients only through\ncorrespondence the cooperation was not adequate for accomplishing\ncomplete improvement. While it is true that there is a marked\ndifference in the susceptibility of different individuals to dental\ncaries, even those who would ordinarily be classed as highly\nsusceptible, have generally received permanent benefit from the\ntreatment.These principles of treatment have now been applied to many\nhundreds of patients as indicated by the fact that over 2,800 chemical\nanalyses of the saliva have been made. The dietary programs that have\nbeen recommended have been determined on the basis of a study of the\nnutrition used by the patient, the data provided by the x-rays, from\nthe saliva analysis and case history. The diets have been found to be\ndeficient in minerals, chiefly phosphorus. Fat-soluble vitamins have\nbeen deficient in practically every case of active tooth decay. The\nfoods selected for reinforcing the deficient nutritions have always\nincluded additional fatsoluble vitamins and a liberal source of\nminerals in the form of natural food. Human beings cannot absorb\nminerals satisfactorily from inorganic chemicals. Great harm is done,\nin my judgment, by the sale and use of substitutes for natural\nfoods.One of our greatest difficulties in undertaking to apply the\nwisdom of the primitives to our modern problems involves a character\nfactor. The Indians of the high Andes were willing to go hundreds of\nmiles to the sea to get kelp and fish eggs for the use of their people.\nYet many of our modern people are unwilling to take sufficient trouble\nto obtain foods that are competent to accomplish the desired\nresults.Jobbers and middlemen as well as supply depot managers want\nbutter sold in accordance with its label rather than in accordance with\nits vitamin content. One large distributor whom I asked to cooperate by\nmaintaining a stock of high-vitamin butter to which I could refer\npeople, told me frankly that he wished I would stop telling people\nabout the difference in the vitamins in butter. He did not wish them to\nthink of butter in terms of its vitamin content. Another large concern\ntold me that when I had worked up a sufficiently large market they\nwould become interested in supplying the demand. I counsel people to\nput in storage some of that butter which has the grassy flavor and\nwhich melts easily and is produced when the cows go onto the rapidly\ngrowing young grass. Unfortunately, cows that have been on a stable\nfodder low in carotene and under the stress of gestation often are so\ndepleted in their own body vitamins that it takes them three or four\nweeks to replenish their own bodies when they get on good pasture. Then\nthe vitamins will appear in liberal quantity in their milk. This has\nmade it necessary for me to assist many patients in obtaining a supply\nby analyzing butter for its vitamin content and then putting this\nmaterial in storage and making it available for special cases as\nneeded.The program that I have found most efficient has been one which\nincludes the use of small quantities of very high vitamin butter mixed\nin equal parts with a very high vitamin cod liver oil. A simple method\nof preparing the butter is by melting it and allowing it to cool for\ntwenty-four hours at a temperature of about 70° F., then\ncentrifugalizing it which provides an oil that remains liquid at room\ntemperature. When this butter oil is mixed in equal parts with a very\nhigh-vitamin cod liver oil, it produces a product that is more\nefficient than either alone. It should be used within a couple of weeks\nof the time it is mixed. It is desirable that this material be made\navailable in various parts of the country. Even the high-vitamin butter\nproduced on the early summer growth of grass put in storage and used\nduring the winter will go far toward solving our great national problem\nof shortage of fat-soluble vitamins. The quantity of the mixture of\nbutter oil and cod liver oil required is quite small, half a\nteaspoonful three times a day with meals is sufficient to control\nwide-spread tooth decay when used with a diet that is low in sugar and\nstarches and high in foods providing the minerals, particularly\nphosphorus. A teaspoonful a day divided between two or three meals is\nusually adequate to prevent dental caries and maintain a high immunity;\nit will also maintain freedom from colds and a high level of health in\ngeneral. This reinforcement of the fat-soluble vitamins to a menu that\nis low in starches and sugars, together with the use of bread and\ncereal grains freshly ground to retain the full content of the embryo\nor germ, and with milk for growing children and for many adults, and\nthe liberal use of sea foods and organs of animals, produced the result\ndescribed.I have previously reported(3)seventeen\ncases of extensive dental caries. In these patients there were found\n237 open cavities of apparently active caries. Most of the individuals\nwere between twelve and twenty years of age and accordingly had\ntwenty-eight permanent teeth each, or a total of 476. It will be noted\nthat if one cavity is allowed per tooth, approximately half of the\ntotal number of teeth were affected, or precisely 49.7 per cent of all\nthe teeth had open cavities. This group includes only persons of whom I\nhave been making critical examination every six to twelve months over a\nthree-year period. In practically all cases, Roentgen-ray examinations\nwere made in addition to clinical examinations of the teeth. While\nthese persons have been on the reinforced nutritional program during\nthe winter and spring months of the past three years, only two new\ncavities have developed in the group, or 0.4 per cent. The length of\ntime during which the cavities previously found had been developing is\nnot known beyond the fact that all of the patients were receiving\nfrequent and thorough dental service, most of them twice a year and\nmany of them more frequently. It is accordingly probable that the\ncavities found had developed in less than a year. That dental caries\nwas not a new problem with these persons was indicated by the very\nextensive and numerous dental restorations that had been made in their\nmouths. It is, therefore, apparent that 250 times as many cavities\ndeveloped in the period preceding the starting of the nutritional\nprogram as in the three years following its adoption. If these data\nwere reduced to a yearly basis, the comparison would show a much wider\nvariation.In a group of fifty persons, including the above mentioned\nseventeen, who had been on the special nutritional program for from one\nto six years, most of them three years or more, only two new cavities\ndeveloped. Allowing these persons to have an average of twenty-eight\nteeth per person, or a total of 1,400 teeth, this would represent an\nincidence of dental caries in a period of three years of 0.14 per cent.\nIn this group of fifty, there are many instructive and striking\ncases.For example, H. F. did not have a single cavity from October,\n1932, to June, 1933, while taking additional vitamins and high mineral\nfoods. From June, 1933, to May, 1934, while not taking the special\nvitamins, she developed ten new cavities.S. K., prior to 1931 had rampant tooth decay with pulps nearly\nexposed in all first permanent molars. The remaining deciduous teeth\nhad been reduced to shells. She was on the special nutritional program\nfrom December, 1931, to June, 1932, during which time caries was\ncompletely arrested. She discontinued taking special oil in June, 1932,\nand did not take it again until October, 1933, during most of which\ntime she was taking viosterol under a physician's prescription to\nprevent dental caries. She came in October, 1933, with fourteen new\ncavities. She was immediately placed again on the special program, from\nOctober, 1933, to May, 1934. During this period, the dental caries was\ncompletely under control. During the time that she was not on the\nspecial program, there developed on many of the surfaces of the\npermanent teeth white patches of decalcifying enamel. Under the\nreinforced nutritional program, these largely disappeared, and those\nthat did not regain their translucency turned dark.Among the group of seventeen J. H., sent in from another city,\nhad thirty-eight open cavities in June, 193 1. In addition to active\ncaries, he had quite disturbing heart symptoms, which curtailed his\nactivity, and he also had a marked sense of lassitude and weariness. He\nhas been on the reinforced nutritional program during the fall, winter\nand spring of each year since that time. During this time, he has not\ndeveloped a single new cavity. The density of all the teeth has\nprogressively improved as evidenced by Roentgen-ray records. His\nphysical condition has been greatly improved so that he is able to\ncarry on his college activities and heavy outside work to earn money to\nmaintain his college expenses. He is not conscious of a heart\nlimitation. When asked what the principal change was that he had\nnoticed, he said that in addition to not feeling tired, he was more\nrested with six hours' sleep than formerly with ten hours'.A. W. had thirty-two new cavities in the two years previous to\nbeginning the special nutritional reinforcement. She continued this\nregularly during the winter and spring months for three years and has\nnot had a single new cavity since that time.In a group of children whose mothers had the special nutritional\nreinforcement during gestation and lactation and who had been provided\nwith the same dietary adjuncts during the winter and spring months of\ninfancy and early childhood, not a single carious cavity has developed.\nA number of these children are now in public schools. Their physical\ndevelopment is distinctly above that of the average children of their\nage, as is also their efficiency in school work.It is important that I emphasize here some dangers that are not\nusually recognized or properly emphasized in the literature. When fish\noils including cod liver oils are given in too large doses to some\npatients they experience quite definite symptoms of depression. The\navailable evidence indicates that fish oils that have been exposed to\nthe air may develop toxic substances. My work and that of others with\nexperimental animals has demonstrated that paralysis can be produced\nreadily by over-dosing. Serious structural damage can be done to hearts\nand kidneys. I have reported this in considerable detail.(4)My investigations have shown that when a high vitamin\nnatural cod liver oil is used in conjunction with a high vitamin butter\noil the mixture is much more efficient than either alone.4 This makes\nit possible to use very small doses. Except in the late stages of\npregnancy I do not prescribe more than half a teaspoonful with each of\nthree meals a day. This procedure appears to obviate completely the\nundesirable effects. As stated elsewhere fish oils should be stored in\nsmall containers to avoid exposure to the air. Rancid fats and oils\ndestroy vitamins A and E,(5)the former in the\nstomach.(6)I am frequently reminded that ancient\nskulls are often found with extensive dental caries thus disproving\nthat the primitive groups were more free from dental caries than the\nmodern groups. It must be kept in mind that the fundamental laws of\nNature have been in operation as long as animals and men have been on\nthe earth. In my investigations among primitive races, I have been\nconcerned particularly with the study of changes that have taken place\nboth in immunity to dental caries and in the environment, including the\nfoods used. It has been important that I find large groups with\nrelatively high immunity to dental caries to be used as controls. There\nis great need, accordingly, that additional data be provided.\nFortunately, this need is being met. There have just come to my desk\ntwo interesting reports; one, from Dr. Arne Hoygaard(7)and the other from Dr. P. O. Pedersen.(8)These two distinguished scientists have spent a year in\nEast Greenland among the Eskimos in that very barren and isolated\nregion. The percentage of teeth found attacked by dental caries among\nthe isolated Eskimos of East Greenland is exceedingly low, less than 1\nper cent. Where the Eskimos were in contact with modernized store foods\nat the port, tooth decay was active. The conditions which they have\nfound were apparently not quite so favorable as in the groups I studied\nin Alaska. The Greenland Eskimos apparently are living in a more\ndifficult environment. The data provided by these investigations are in\naccord with the data I have obtained among isolated Eskimos and other\nprimitive racial stocks. Eastern Greenland, by international agreement,\nis administered by the Danish Government and no one is permitted even\nto visit the coast of Greenland without special permission. This\npermission is very difficult to obtain. Even Danish citizens are not\nfree to travel there. We are, accordingly, very grateful to Dr.\nHoygaard and Dr. Pedersen for their contribution from studies made in\nthat protected field. We shall look forward with interest to their\ndetailed reports.Unfortunately, the public is very much at sea because of the\nextravagant claims that are made for many of the products advertised\nover the radio, in journals, and by door to door solicitation. A\ndependable and helpful booklet on the vitamin content of foods has been\npublished by the United States Department of Agriculture, Miscellaneous\nPublications, No. 275. The fact should always be emphasized that foods\nas Nature makes them have much more nutritional value than after they\nare processed so that insect life cannot live on them. When foods\ncannot support insect life they cannot support human life.A report has just appeared in the September number of the New\nZealand Dental Journal by H. H. Tocker on behalf of the Hawkes Bay\nBranch of the New Zealand Dental Association in which he reports the\nresults of the application of my suggestions in the Hukarere School for\nnative Maori girls at Napier. I have reported my studies there in\nChapter 12. They used only one part of my suggestions for checking the\nactivity of dental caries. The diet of both their control group and\ntested group was the same except for one item, i.e., \"one heaped\nteaspoonful twice daily of malt and cod liver oil.\" In a group of\nsixty-six native girls the thirty-three with the best teeth were used\nas a control group. The remaining thirty-three were given the\nadditional fat-soluble vitamins. In six months' time ~resistance of\nthis group was raised by 41.75 per cent\" as compared with the control\ngroup. The nutrition of the test group was not adequately reinforced to\nobtain the best results. There was a marked inadequacy of mineral\ncarrying foods in proportion to the energy and heat providing factors\nin the foods. An adequate quantity of such efficient foods should be as\nreadily available today as before the white men came to New\nZealand.It is important to summarize at this point some of the data that\nI have developed in other chapters because of their direct relation to\nthe control of dental caries and other degenerative processes. Since\nhuman life like other animal life has been developed in Nature's\nlaboratory to fit Nature's natural foods we run a great risk when we\nundertake to modify seriously these foods. Bakers' so-called whole\nwheat bread is not comparable to Nature's foods that provide entire\nwheat and other cereals, because of the factors that have been removed\nfrom the wheat either mechanically or by oxidation. This is so large a\nproblem that adequate changes in the available grain foods cannot be\nmade until there 15 sufficient public demand to produce them through\nthe normal channels of supply and demand. It is primarily a problem for\nour Federal and State governments. Packaged foods containing dry\ncereals can undergo important changes, even while the material is being\nprocessed or while in packages on the shelves. The determinations of\nthe loss of vitamins in packaged foods as reported in 1938 by the\nAgricultural Experimental Station of Oklahoma Agricultural and\nMechanical College, reveal that a material loss occurs in two weeks'\ntime and a very serious loss in one to two months' time in certain\nstock rations.An important source of misapprehension is the literature and\nteachings of fadists. Such, for example, as the misapprehension of many\npeople that they must use only alkaline producing foods and that a\ngreat danger is associated with the use of acid producing foods. In the\nprimitive races I have found practically no difference between the acid\nbalance meat diet of the isolated Eskimos of the far north and the less\nacid vegetable and milk diet of other groups as efficient factors in\ncontrol of caries. It is important to keep in mind that our bodies have\na mechanism for maintaining proper acid and alkali balance in the blood\nand this varies through only a very narrow limit whether the balance of\nthe total food eaten is acid or alkaline. It is also important to have\nin mind that there are certain fat-soluble vitamins provided in dairy\nproducts in adequate quantity that cannot all be supplied in fish oils.\nAlso that overdosing with cod liver oil and other fish oils can be\ndefinitely detrimental. When packages of cod liver oil are purchased\nfrom the trade the material should be received in full containers not\nexposed to air and when opened should be transferred to small units so\nit is not progressively oxidized during the period of its use.The excess of calories over body building minerals is exceedingly\nhigh in sweets of various kinds regardless of their special branding\nand the methods of manufacture and storage. There is very little of the\nbody building minerals in maple syrup, cane syrup from sugar or honey.\nThey can all defeat an otherwise efficient dietary. The problem is not\nso simple as merely cutting down or eliminating sugars and white flour\nthough this is exceedingly important. It is also necessary that\nadequate mineral and vitamin carrying foods be made available. It is\nalso necessary to realize that many of our important foods for\nproviding vitamins are very low in body building material. For example,\none would have to eat nearly a bushel of apples a day or half a bushel\nof oranges to obtain a liberal factor of safety for providing\nphosphorus; similarly one would be required to eat nine and one half\npounds of carrots or eleven pounds of beets each day to get enough\nphosphorus for a liberal factor of safety, while this quantity would be\nprovided in one pound of lentils or beans, wheat or oats. I have\ndiscussed elsewhere the availability of phosphorus depending upon its\nchemical form. Since the calories largely determine the satisfying of\nthe appetite and since under ordinary circumstances we stop when we\nhave obtained about two thousand to twenty-five hundred very little of\nthe highly sweetened fruits defeats our nutritional program. We would\nhave to consume daily the contents of thirty-two one pound jars of\nmarmalade, jellies or jams to provide a two gram intake of phosphorus.\nThis quantity would provide 32,500 calories; an amount impossible for\nthe system to take care of.Milk is one of the best foods for providing minerals but it may\nbe inadequate in several vitamins. Of all of the primitive groups\nstudied those using sea foods abundantly appear to obtain an adequate\nquantity of minerals particularly phosphorus with the greatest ease, in\npart because the fat-soluble vitamins provided in the sea foods (by\nwhich I mean animal life of the sea) are usually high. This enables a\nmore efficient utilization of the minerals, calcium and phosphorus.As I study routinely the sample dietaries being used by people\nsuffering from dental caries, usually associated with other\ndisturbances, I find large numbers who are not getting in their food\neven half the minimum requirements of calcium, phosphorus and magnesium\nand iron and usually only a fraction of the minimum requirements of the\nfat-soluble vitamins. These latter have a role which in many respects\nis like the battery of an automobile which provides the spark for\nigniting the fuel. Even though the tank is filled with gasoline there\nis no power without the igniting spark.There are two programs now available for meeting the dental\ncaries problem. One is to know first in detail all the physical and\nchemical factors involved and then proceed. The other is to know how to\nprevent the disease as the primitives have shown and then proceed. The\nformer is largely the practice of the moderns. The latter is the\nprogram suggested by these investigations. Available data indicate that\nthe blood and saliva normally carry defensive factors which when\npresent control the growth of the acid producing organisms and the\nlocal reactions at tooth surfaces. When these defensive factors are not\npresent the acid producing organisms multiply and produce an acid which\ndissolves tooth structure. The origin of this protective factor is\nprovided in nutrition and is directly related to the mineral content of\nthe foods and to known and unknown vitamins particularly the\nfat-soluble. Clinical data demonstrate that by following the program\noutlined dental caries can be prevented or controlled when active in\npractically all individuals. This does not require either permission or\nprescription but it is the inherent right of every individual. A\nproperly balanced diet is good for the entire body.REFERENCESTISDALL, F.

The constant reproduction of ancestral patterns constitutes\none of the fundamental laws of heredity. We are concerned here with the\ndivergences from the normal course of reproduction.The precision with which Nature reproduces widely distributed\nracial stocks demonstrates how deeply seated and controlling are the\nMendelian laws. In Fig. 98 may be seen four young men of the Melanesian\nrace born on four different islands. They have never seen each other,\nyet they look like brothers. Similarly, in Fig. 99 are shown four\nPolynesian girls. Here again they look so much alike that they might\nreadily be taken for sisters. Yet, they live in four different groups\nof Polynesian islands; the Hawaiian, the Samoan, the Tahitian, and the\nRarotongan.FIG. 98. These four Melanesian\nboys born on different islands look like brothers but are not blood\nrelations. They illustrate the role of heredity in reproducing racial\ntype. Heredity, however, can only operate normally when the germ cells\nhave not been injured.99. These four Polynesian girls\nlive on different islands and are not related though they look like\nsisters. They record their racial type by undisturbed\nheredity.The blending of different racial stocks produces typical\ncharacteristics of either or both ancestral patterns. When, however,\nmarked divergences appear without mixing of racial stocks, the result\nis not due to heredity, but occurs in spite of heredity. In the\nprevious chapters, I have shown that in the modernized groups of\nvarious primitive racial stocks, ccrtain individuals developed marked\nchanges in facial and dental arch form from the racial pattern. We are\ninterested to know the nature of the forces responsible for this\ndistortion of the ancestral pattern. In a study of 1,276 skulls of the\nancient civilizations of Peru, I did not find one with a typical\ndivergence from normal such as we find in modern whites or in children\nof primitive racial stocks after the parents have adopted the foods of\nour modern civilization. It is important that we study this phase in\nfurther detail.In Fig. 100 are shown two Indian fathers and their sons, whom we\nstudied in Peru. The father and son shown above lived at Talara, in a\nhighly modernized Indian colony. The father worked in the oil fields on\nthe coast. This district is an arid desert into which practically all\nfood has to be shipped for the large colony engaged in the oil\nindustry. The father was born while his parents were using the native\nfoods of the coast, including an abundance of sea foods. The son was\nborn to his parents after they had adopted the foods of modern\ncivilization. The father and son shown below, lived in the high\nSierras. The father is an Indian descendant of the Incas and was born\nwhile his parents were living on the native dietary of the high plateau\ncountry, near Cuzco. After the adoption of the modern foods by the\nparents, the son shown to the right was born. It is important to keep\nin mind that the marked change in these fathers and sons has occurred\nin the first generation after the parents have adopted the white man's\nfoods, and has occurred in spite of heredity.FIG. 100. Disturbed heredity.\nAbove, father a primitive coastal Indian of Peru with normal facial and\ndental arch development. Son at right presents distortions of both\nfacial and dental arch form. Below, father a primitive Andean Indian\nwith excellent facial and dental arch form. His son at right has not\nreproduced the racial pattern. Both sons are full\nblood.In Fig. 101 above is shown a Wakamba father in central Africa, a\nman who is working for the railroad company which contributed largely\nto the food supply for the laborers. The boy shown at the right was\nborn after the parents had adopted the imported foods. In the lower\npicture, in Fig. 101, is seen a Fiji Islander and his son. The father\nwas born to parents living on the native foods, and his son was born\nafter the adoption of the white man's foods. All these are typical\ncases of the inhibition of Nature's normal procedure. We have\nadditional data which indicate that our problem is associated with a\nprogressive lowering of reproductive capacity on the part of one or\nboth of the parents.FIG. 101. Disturbed heredity.\nAbove, the father is a primitive Wakamba of Central Africa. His son at\nright has not reproduced the tribal pattern. Below, the father presents\nthe typical Fijian primitive facial and dental arch form. His son at\nright has a narrowed arch and change in facial form. Both sons are full\nblood.In photographing the members of modernized families, regardless\nof racial stocks, we frequently find that changes in facial expression\nappear in the younger members of the family. This change in facial\ncontour within a family does not occur in the primitive races, while on\ntheir native dietary.In contrast with this we see, in Fig. 102, two sisters and two\nbrothers. In each pair there is a marked change in the facial form of\nthe younger. The arches and the nostrils of the younger child are\nnarrower and there is a marked lack of development in both the middle\nand lower thirds of the face.FIG. 102. Disturbed heredity.\nQuichua Indians. Note the marked change in shape of the face and dental\narches of the younger sister at the right. Also of the younger brother\nat the right. These families demonstrate a lowering of reproductive\ncapacity of the parents with the later born children.Very striking illustrations of this progressive degeneration in\nthe children of a given family were found among the modernized\naborigines of Australia. Two views of brothers are shown in Fig. 103\n(upper). The father and mother of these two boys were born in the Bush.\nThey were living, when photographed, in one of the reservations, on the\nimported modern foods which were provided by the government. This is\nalso illustrated in the lower photograph. Note the marked\nunderdevelopment of the middle third of the face of the girl.FIG. 103. Disturbed heredity.\nThese children are Australian Aborigines. Note the marked change in\nfacial and dental arch form in the younger child at the right in both\nfamilies. This is depressed reproductive capacity of the\nparents.Striking instances were frequently seen among the modernized\nMaori of New Zealand. Two sisters presenting two extremes of facial\nform are shown in the upper section of Fig. 104. The girl to the left\nis the older. She has the typical tribal pattern which has been\ncompletely lost in her younger sister to the right.FIG. 104. Above, two Maori\ngirls in New Zealand and below, two white girls in Peru. Note the\nfacial change in the girls at the right compared with their older\nsisters.If the change in facial form were the result of racial\nadmixture, we should not have the types of deformity patterns that\nthese cases show. Indeed, in the same family we should not find several\ndifferent deformity patterns. The lack of development downward of the\nupper anterior incisors and the bone supporting them is illustrated for\nthe younger child, in Fig. 103 lower right. It will be noted that when\nthis girl's molar teeth are in contact her front teeth still miss\noccluding by a considerable distance.Members of the white race are affected in a similar manner. In\nFig. 104 (lower) are shown two sisters; the younger to the right\nreveals strikingly the lack of development of the middle and lower\nthird of the face. The fact that this condition so frequently shows a\nprogressively severe injury in the younger members of the family is a\nmatter of great importance in tracing the causative factors. It is\nimportant to keep in mind that when the injury shows in the face of the\nyoung child it becomes worse when the adult face forms. This increase\nin deformity occurs at the time of the development of the permanent\ndentition, at from ten to fourteen years of age.In the islands north of Australia where contact with modern\ncivilization is just being made, the adult individuals showed a\nconstant reproduction of the tribal pattern, while those born since\ncontact was made, had many divergences from normal. In Fig. 105 will be\nseen a family of six individuals. Four were born before the modern\nstore was put on that island and two after the parents had come into\ncontact with the influence of the imported foods. It will be seen that\nthe four older brothers show marked uniformity of facial design, and\nthat all have reproduced the tribal pattern. The two younger members\nshow definite change in facial pattern. This is also illustrated in\nFig. 106 above, in which the oldest brother was born before the store\nwas put on Badu Island, and the three younger, after the establishment\nof the store twenty-three years ago.FIG. 105. Of these six brothers\nthe four older were born on Badu Island before the white man's store\nwas established. The two younger at right below, after. Note change in\nfacial form.FIG. 106. Above, the brother at\nthe right was born before the store was put on Badu Island, the three\nyounger, after. Note the change in facial form. Below, note that the\ndental arches are too constricted to provide space for the erupting\ncuspids. This boy is the one shown at the left in Figure\n107.This problem of progressive degeneration in the younger members\nof the family is again illustrated by the group shown in Fig. 107. The\nolder girl has reproduced the tribal pattern of the race with normal\nbroad, dental arches. The second girl shows marked narrowing and\nlengthening of the face. The third child, a boy, shows very marked\ndivergence from the tribal pattern. This group is shown below with\ntheir teeth exposed. It will be seen that the oldest girl has broad\ndental arches typical of Nature's normal design. The second girl has a\nmarked depression laterally in the molar and bicuspid region producing\na narrowing of the palate. The third child has in addition to the\nnarrowing of the face a marked deficiency in bone growth so that the\ncuspids both above and below are forced entirely outside the arch. The\ntotal circumference as well as the breadth of the upper arch is so\nreduced that space is not available for the cuspids. They will be seen\nimbedded high in the tissue, as illustrated in the lower picture of\nFig. 106.FIG. 107. Natives from islands\nnorth of Australia. Above, note the progressive facial change in the\nyounger sister and brother with lengthening and narrowing of the face\nand body. Below, note the broad arches of the oldest girl at the right,\nlateral depression of the bicuspids and molars of the next girl and\ninadequate bone development of the boy's face. These are on an island\nnorth of Australia.Fig. 108 shows three white girl scouts in New Zealand. Note that\nprogressive narrowing of the body including both shoulders and hips has\noccurred in the younger members of the family. This is also shown in\nFig. 107.FIG. 108. White Girl Scouts,\nNew Zealand. Note the progressive lengthening and narrowing of the face\nand narrowing of the hips in the younger girl at the\nleft.It would be remarkable if these disturbances in the physical\npattern were limited to the face and dental arches. An illustration of\nother deficiency injuries is shown in Fig. 109, which shows three\nchildren in a modernized Maori family. It will be seen that while the\noldest girl has the typical Maori racial pattern of face, there is a\nmarked lack of development of the middle third of the face, with\nprogressive severity of distortion in her two younger brothers. On\nobserving the feet it will be seen that she has splendidly formed feet\nwhile the second child has flat feet, and the third child has clubbed\nfeet.FIG. 109. New Zealand Mann.\nNote the progressive change in facial form of the two younger boys as\ncompared with their older sister. Then note the progressive change in\ntheir feet. Normal feet, flat feet and club feet.I have found similar examples in several of the modernized\nprimitive racial stocks. The severity of the disturbing factors may be\ndifferent under different circumstances. Drought, industrial\ndepression, unemployment, and the like, all have their influence. In\nFig. 110 will be seen three Maori children of New Zealand; the second\nchild is smaller in stature than the third and gives more evidence of\nfacial injury. While his older sister and younger brother have normal\nfeet, his quite severe disturbance in facial growth is associated with\nclub feet.FIG. 110. New Zealand Maori.\nNote the marked undersize of the second child and underdevelopment of\nthe face associated with marked deformity of the feet.I have one patient who was the seventh of a family of eleven\nchildren. All the children in the family have good facial development,\nexcept this patient. She was born in the midst of a severe financial\ndepression when the total amount of money available for the food for\nthe family was reduced to a very low level. The other children were\nborn before or after the depression, and were not injured. In addition\nto this patient's severe facial deformity, she has had some arthritis\nand a general rheumatic tendency. Her facial injury is marked and is\ncharacterized by a lack of development of the middle third.Deformities of the feet associated with facial deformity have\nbeen found in several modernized groups of primitive racial stocks. A\ntypical case among the modernized Indians of Peru is shown in Fig. 111.\nThe face of this boy shows abnormal development with narrowing of the\nupper arch and displacement of the teeth. This is associated with gross\ndeformity of one foot and shortening of the leg. He lives in the high\ncountry. This phase is strikingly illustrated in Fig. 112 where the\nface is very badly injured and both feet are seriously clubbed. This\nboy is a Coastal Indian.FIG. 111. This boy is a\nmodernized Indian in the high Sierra of Peru. Note the disturbed\ndevelopment of the face associated with the deformity of one\nfoot.FIG. 112. This is a modernized\ncoastal Indian of Ecuador. Note the serious facial and dental arch\ndistortion associated with club feet.The serious expressions of physical deformities which we found\nhad occurred in several primitive racial stocks, after they have become\nmodernized sufficiently to be using the foods of our modern\ncivilization, are occurring in our modern American families with equal\nseverity and great frequency.One method for determining the cause of these deformities is\nthrough an examination of birth and death certificates to note the\nrecorded data relative to physical deformities. An outstanding\ncontribution to this approach has been made by Dr. D. P. Murphy, of the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania. In an examination of 130,132 individual\ndeath certificates that have been recorded between 1929 and 1933, he\nfound physical deformities recorded in 1,476 cases. Dr. Murphy sent\nfield workers to make a personal study of the family histories by\ncontacting the mothers or grandmothers, of whom they were able to\nlocate 890. From this group he was able to select 405 with sufficiently\ncomplete family histories to allow tabulation in a form that would\nthrow light upon the birth rank and other data. His studies strongly\nemphasize the presence of a period of low reproductive activity. In\nconcluding one of his reports he states:(1)Miscarriages, stillbirths, and premature births\noccurred more often than would be expected by chance in the pregnancies\nimmediately preceding and immediately following the pregnancy which\nresulted in the birth of a defective child, and less often than would\nbe expected by chance in the remaining pregnancies. Miscarriage,\nstillbirth, and premature birth occurred most often in the pregnancy\nimmediately preceding that of the defective child.From the above observations, it is concluded\nthat the birth of a congenitally malformed child may be only one\nexpression of a prolonged decrease in functional reproductive activity,\nthe other expressions being miscarriages, stillbirths, and premature\nbirths.It is suggested that the obstetrician has\nunusual reason to suspect the possible existence of a congenital\nmalformation in the pregnancy which follows immediately after a\nmiscarriage, a stillbirth, or a premature birth.Shute, of the University of Western Ontario, London, Canada, in\na personal communication, states that he has been impressed, in his\nstudies of aborted fetuses, with the large percentage that are\nmalformed. This seems to link the malformations with the causative\nfactors which have resulted in decreased reproductive activity.In connection with the production of imperfect infants, the\nperiod in the formative process at which the injury occurs and also its\norigin are important. Murphy has thrown important light on this phase\nin his study of the cause of the defectives in forty families with two\nor more malformed.(2)He concludes: \"Many if\nnot most of the congenital malformations met with in this study\nresulted from defects in the germ plasm, which were present before\nfertilization.\"Among the important questions that arise is the relative\nresponsibility of the two parents. As an approach to this phase Murphy(2)has made a study which deals with a\nconsecutive series of 884 families in each of which there appeared at\nleast one congenitally malformed child. In forty of these families,\nthere were two or more malformed brothers and sisters. He presents\nextensive data in tabular form from which he takes examples to\nillustrate his interpretation. He states under the \"Clinical Value of\nStudy\" the following:It is evident from the above data (tables) that\nthere is a strong tendency for congenital malformations to duplicate in\nsiblings that belong to a consecutive series of families. And also that\nsuch defects tend to appear rather frequently among their more distant\nrelatives. This duplication of malformations is to be observed in the\ncase of the more serious types of defects, just as it is noticed in the\nless serious ones. These findings lend support to the theory that\ncongenital malformations are primarily the result of influences which\naffect the germ cells prior to, rather than after, fertilization. The\nvalidity of this theory is emphasized by three examples taken from\nTables I and II. Family 17 in Table I contained 3 children with pyloric\nstenosis, two of which were twins. Family 6 in Table II possessed 2\nsiblings with cleft palate, conceived by the same father, but born to\ndifferent mothers. Family 8 in Table II contained 2 children both\nexhibiting an absence of the right half of the diaphragm. It does not\nseem likely that such sequences of events as these could be the result\nof any forces that did not operate until after fertilization had taken\nplace. . . .Since, as has been shown in a previous report,\ncongenital malformations are 24 times more common in siblings of\ndefective children than in the population at large, the present\nobservations should be of added clinical interest.Summary and ConclusionsA consecutive series of 40 families having 2 or\nmore congenitally malformed children has been studied with respect to\nthe duplication of defects in siblings.The defect observed in the first malformed child\nreappeared in a subsequent malformed sibling in about 50 per cent of\nall cases; the 50 per cent remaining including all other possible\ndefects.In a second group of 39 consecutive families, in\nwhich a malformed child possessed a malformed relative, the\nmalformation in the child and in the relative were identical in about\n41 per cent of cases.In 19 non-consecutive families with 2 or more\nmalformed children, the defect of the first child repeated in a\nsubsequent child in over half of the families.It is significant that while these important factors are just\ncoming to light in our modernized civilization, the evidence clearly\nindicates that several so-called primitive races have been conscious of\nthe need for safeguarding motherhood from reproductive overloads which\nwould reduce the capacity for efficient reproduction. For example, G.\nT. Baden(3)in his book \"Among the Ibos of\nNigeria\" states:It is not only a matter of disgrace but an\nactual abomination, for an Ibo woman to bear children at shorter\nintervals than about three years. . . . The idea of a fixed minimum\nperiod between births is based on several sound principles. The belief\nprevails strongly that it is necessary for this interval to elapse in\norder to ensure the mother being able to recuperate her strength\ncompletely, and thus be in a thoroughly fit condition to bear another\nchild. Should a second child be born within the prescribed period the\ntheory is held that it must inevitably be weak and sickly, and its\nchances jeopardized.Similarly, the Indians of Peru, Ecuador and Columbia have been\nfamiliar with the necessity of preventing pregnancy overloads of the\nmother. Whiffen(4)in his book \"North-West\nAmazons\" states:The numbers (of pregnant women) are remarkable\nin view of the fact that husbands abstain from any intercourse with\ntheir wives, not only during pregnancy but also throughout the period\nof lactation--far more prolonged with them than with Europeans. The\nresult is that two and a half years between each child is the minimum\ndifference of age, and in the majority of cases it is even\ngreater.It may also be important to note that the Amazon Indians have\nbeen conscious of the fact that these matters are related to the\nnutrition of both parents. Whiffen states that:These Indians share the belief of many peoples\nof the lower cultures that the food eaten by the parents--to some\ndegree of both parents--will have a definite influence upon the birth,\nappearance, or character of the child.This problem of the consciousness among primitives of the need\nfor spacing children has been emphasized by George Brown(5)in his studies among Melanesians and Polynesians in\nwhich he reports relative to the natives on one of the Solomon Islands\nas follows:After the birth of a child the husband was not\nsupposed to cohabit with his wife until the child could walk. If a\nchild was weak or sickly, the people would say, speaking of the\nparents, \"Ah, well, they have only themselves to blame.\"These new data have a very important bearing on the problems of\ndegeneration in our modern civilization. Since it is true that a racial\npattern can be changed in a single generation our modern concept and\nteaching with regard to the role of heredity must be modified, in its\nrelationship to cause and effect. A deformity arising from intercepted\nheredity is just as truly biologic as a deformity arising from\naccumulated impacts as expressed in heredity. Instead of blaming the\npast generations for the distortions or frailties of our modern\ngeneration and thus relieving our own generation of responsibility\nthese new data indicate that the social organization that is creating\nthese divergencies from normal must alone accept the\nresponsibility.This completely changes some aspects of the theories and\npractice of modern social education. Instead of planning the care and\nmanagement of distorted personality as though the lesion were the\nresult of environmental influences upon a normally organized\nindividual, it should be looked upon as a distortion affecting one link\nin the chain of heredity which is neither the result of the distortions\nof previous links nor a controlling factor for future links in the\nchain. The prognosis, in other words, while being bad for the\nindividual is not necessarily bad for his or her descendants.While many of the individuals who have suffered physical\ndistortions have apparently practically normal brain development we\nshall see in the following chapter that a certain percentage have so\ngreat a disturbance in brain organization that they cannot and should\nnot be considered as individually responsible for their behavior.It is urgent therefore that the data presented in this chapter\nbe looked upon as an important key to the progressive degeneration that\nis taking place in many parts of the world under the influence of our\nso-called modern civilization. It is a matter of profound significance\nthat the most primitive races were originally able to avoid the\nphysical degeneration so general in many communities today. It is also\na matter of importance that the primitives recognized not only these\ndangers but were conscious of and practiced adequate means for\npreventing them. They had sufficient character to achieve the ends\nwhich they deemed essential. Weakness in character may constitute the\ngreatest barrier in the reorganization and conservation of our modern\ncivilization.Two serious defects from which many individuals in our\nmodernized civilization suffer are impacted teeth and the absence of\nteeth due to their failure to develop. It is significant that in the\narches of the primitive races practically all teeth form and erupt\nnormally, including the third molars. In the modernized primitives and\namong our modern whites with deformed dental arches many teeth are\nimpacted and often several of the permanent teeth have never formed.\nThe evidence indicates that this, like the facial and dental arch\ndeformities is due to an absence of vitamin A in the diet of the mother\nduring the gestation period or of one or both of the parents prior to\nconception. The cause is discussed in the next chapter.REFERENCESMURPHY, D. P. Reproductive efficiency and malformed children.Surg. Gynec. and Obst.,62:585, 1936.MURPHY, D. P.

The skill of many physicians in reading intuitively and\nfrom external signs the nature of their patients' troubles when these\ncould not be classified with precision played an important part in the\nsuccessful warfare against disease in the period preceding the advance\nin modern laboratory technique. For many of the old-time physicians,\nthese constitutional qualities were expressed as diathesis. An\nindividual would be recognized as having a phthisical diathesis (a\nsusceptibility to tuberculosis). Similarly, the arthritis group had a\nrheumatic diathesis. While modern science has undertaken to express its\nfindings numerically, the problem of reducing the diatheses to\nmathematical formulas has required so many overlappings, that it has\nbeen impossible to establish definite limiting boundaries.In my investigations regarding the types of individuals who\ndevelop rheumatic group lesions as a result of dental focal infections,(1)I found that individuals could be divided\ninto very definite groups in which 15.05 per cent with severe lesions\nbelonged to families in which similar disease symptoms had occurred.\nEvidence was disclosed of a systemic factor that played a controlling\nrole in determining whether or not the individual would be seriously\ninjured from dental focal infections. It became very clear that the\nsoil was quite as important a determining factor as was the type of\ninfection. This finding led me to broaden the scope of my\ninvestigations to include a search for control cases that were free\nfrom the degenerative processes. I was not able to find these controls\nin the clinical material afforded by our modern civilization, and\ntherefore extended the search to isolated primitive racial stocks.Associated with a fine physical condition the isolated primitive\ngroups have a high level of immunity to many of our modern degenerative\nprocesses, including tuberculosis, arthritis, heart disease, and\naffections of the internal organs. When, however, these individuals\nhave lost this high level of physical excellence a definite lowering in\ntheir resistance to the modern degenerative processes has taken place.\nTo illustrate, the narrowing of the facial and dental arch forms of the\nchildren of the modernized parents, after they had adopted the white\nman's food, was accompanied by an increase in susceptibility to\npulmonary tuberculosis.In Fig. 113 will be seen four young people, examined in the\ntuberculosis wards of the Juneau (Alaska) Hospital for Indians and\nEskimos. All exhibited marked evidence of prenatal injury. Note the\ncuspids erupting outside the line of the arch. The teeth of the upper\narch of the boy at the upper left, pass inside the teeth of the lower\narch. His upper arch is so narrow that even a finger could not be\npassed between the lateral walls. These pictures had to be taken with\nshort exposures in the poor light of the wards. They reveal, however,\nthe conditions.FIG. 113. Eskimo children\nseriously ill in the tuberculosis wards of the government hospital at\nJuneau, Alaska. They were too ill to be moved to good light for\nphotographing. Every tubercular child in these wards had disturbed\nfacial development and deformed dental arches. The parents were living\non modern foods.In Figs. 114 and 115 are shown several individuals photographed\nin the tuberculosis hospital in New Zealand. Note the lack of\ndevelopment of the middle third of the face and the narrowing and\nlengthening of the face. In several individuals the teeth of the upper\narch closed inside the teeth of the lower arch, instead of outside, as\nin normal persons. Here again, 100 per cent of the young people with\ntuberculosis gave evidence of injury in the formative period, and 91.2\nper cent of the total number of patients were found to have disturbed\ndental arches.FIG. 114. These are patients in\nthe Maori Hospital for tuberculosis in New Zealand. Note the very\nmarked underdevelopment of the middle third of the face above and of\nboth middle and lower thirds of the face below. Every patient under\nthirty years of age in these wards had deformed dental arches and\ndisturbed facial development.FIG. 115. These girls are also\nin the tuberculosis ward of the New Zealand Hospital for Maori. Note\nthe marked disturbance in development of the face and dental arches.\nAll have pinched nostrils.In Fig. 116 are shown four typical individuals in the\ntuberculosis hospitals in Hawaii; one in Hilo and the other in\nHonolulu. In each of these hospitals 100 per cent of the individuals\nhad abnormal development of the face and dental arches.FIG. 116. These are native\nHawajians in tuberculosis hospitals. Every child in the wards showed\nmarked disturbance of facial development and dental arch\nform.While we know many of the factors contributing to the nature of\ndiatheses, I have found no data dealing with the forces which determine\ndiatheses, except the influence of heredity. The data I am presenting\nin this volume, deal with forces other than heredity.An outstanding advance in organizing the data which relate the\nphysical characteristics of individuals to their disease\nsusceptibilities has been made by the Constitutional Clinic of Columbia\nUniversity and the Presbyterian Hospital of New York, under the able\ndirection of Dr. George Draper. He has found it necessary in order to\nstudy man as a whole, to view him from four different angles: \"his\nform, his function, his immunity mechanism and his psychology.\" These\nfour attributes he has designated as the \"four panels of personality.\"\nDr. Draper has published several communications including two\ntextbooks, one entitled, \"Human Constitution,\"(2)and the other, \"Disease and the Man.\"(3)Dr. Draper has approached this problem from the data\nprovided in the medical clinics, and therefore, from the\ncharacteristics of affected individuals, whereas my approach has been\nthrough a study of the primitive groups and the physical changes and\ndisease susceptibilities which occur as a result of their\nmodernization. The similarity of our conclusions greatly emphasizes the\nimportance of the findings of each. Dr. Draper has emphasized the\nimportance of the face and of the dental arches in the general matter\nof susceptibility to disease. He closes one of his chapters, entitledThe Relation of Face, Jaws and Teeth to Human Constitution and Its\nBearing on Disease,as follows:The lessons which we have learned from these\nobservations, however, is that the face and jaws hold much information\nof value to the student of the human being. As clinicians in the field\nof internal medicine we have been taught to observe the gums and teeth\nin order to detect possible foci of infection. But for the student of\nclinical organismalism, the teeth and jaws hold much valuable\ninformation about the total personality. For the worker in the dental\nbranch of medicine it would seem that an unusual opportunity is offered\nfor extending such observations and correlations. It may very well be\nthat the dental student who becomes interested in the relation of the\nmouth to the organism may form a most important link with the\nresponsibilities of internal medicine.The more we come to view man as a totality, as\nan organism which functions as a whole and not as a collection of\nseparate elements, the more do all the special branches of medicine\nbecome fused with the general concept which forms the basis of this\ndiscussion, namely, the relation of the human organism as a whole to\nthose various reactions of maladjustment with environment which we call\ndisease.It is clear that a definite association of abnormal facial\npatterns with specific disease susceptibilities exists. From my studies\nit is also clear that these abnormal facial patterns are associated\nwith influences resulting from a change in the nutrition of the parents\nof the individual. We are at this point concerned with the forces that\nunderlie these phenomena.In approaching this problem as it applies to human beings, much\ncan be learned from a study of domestic and wild animals. Until recent\nyears it has been common knowledge among the superintendents of large\nzoos of America and Europe that members of the cat family did not\nreproduce efficiently in captivity, unless the mothers had been born in\nthe jungle. Formerly, this made it necessary to replenish lions,\ntigers, leopards and other felines from wild stock as fast as the cages\nwere emptied by death or as rapidly as new stock should be added by\nenlargement.The story is told of a trip to Africa made by a wild animal\nspecialist from the London zoo for the purpose of obtaining additional\nlions and studying this problem. While in the lion country, he observed\nthe lion kill a zebra. The lion proceeded then to tear open the abdomen\nof the zebra and eat the entrails at the right flank. This took him\ndirectly to the liver. After spending some time selecting different\ninternal organs, the lion backed away and turned and pawed dirt over\nthe carcass which he abandoned to the jackals. The scientist hurried to\nthe carcass and drove away the jackals to study the dead zebra to note\nwhat tissues had been taken. This gave him the clue which when put into\npractice has entirely changed the history of the reproduction of the\ncat family in captivity. The addition of the organs to the foods of the\ncaptive animals born in the jungle supplied them with foods needed to\nmake reproduction possible. Their young, too, could reproduce\nefficiently. As I studied this matter with the director of a large lion\ncolony, he listed in detail the organs and tissues that were\nparticularly selected by animals in the wilds and also those that were\nprovided for animals reproducing in captivity. He explained that,\nwhereas the price of lions used to be fifteen hundred dollars for a\ngood specimen, they were now so plentiful that they would scarcely\nbring fifteen cents. If we observe the parts of an animal that a cat\neats when it kills a small rodent or bird, we see that it does not\nselect exclusively the muscle meat.During my biological investigations using animals, I have had\nbarn rats gnaw their way into the room where the rabbits were kept and\nkill several animals during a night. On two different occasions, only\nthe eyes of the rabbits had been eaten, and the blood may have been\nsucked. On another occasion the brains had been eaten. It was evident\nthat these rats had a conscious need for special food elements that\nwere provided by these tissues.No phases of the problem of physical degeneration can be as\nimportant as knowledge of the forces that are at work and the methods\nby which they operate. It is clear from the data presented in previous\nchapters that these forces can become operative with sufficient speed\nto make a difference in two generations, one succeeding the other. It\nis also clear from preceding data that these forces originate in the\nchange of the nutrition of the parents.A chemical analysis of the food (Chapter 15), discloses a marked\nreduction in the intake of some of the vitamins and minerals in\nindividuals who are undergoing a degenerative process.Many investigators have presented important data dealing with\nthe role of vitamin A in prenatal as well as postnatal growth\nprocesses. It is known that the eye is one of the early tissues to\ndevelop injury from the absence of vitamin A, hence the original name\nfor this vitamin was the xerophthalmic vitamin. The importance of\nvitamin A to the eye, and the fact that this vitamin is stored in eye\ntissue have been emphasized by several investigations.Wald(4)in discussing vitamin A in eye\ntissues states:Extracts of eye tissue (retina, pigment\nepithelium and choroid) showed the characteristic vitamin A absorption\nband at 620 mu. with the SbC13 test and were also potent in curing\nvitamin A deficient rats. The concentration of vitamin A was very\nconstant for different mammals, at about 20 Y per g. dry tissue. Values\nfor frog tissues were much higher.This comment is of interest in connection with the observation\nthat I have previously quoted regarding the raid of barn rats on the\nrabbit cages in the stress of deep winter. While it has been shown that\nvitamin A is essential for the normal function of eyes, its role in the\nformation of eye tissues has not been clearly understood. Probably the\nmost sensitive procedure for testing the depletion of vitamin A in\ndomestic animals today is by observing their behavior in\nsemi-darkness.Edward Mellanby(5)has presented\nimportant new data dealing with vitamin A deficiency and deafness. He\nstates in an abstract of a paper read before the Biochemical Society,\nin London in November 1937, the following:In previous publications I have shown that a\nprominent lesion caused by vitamin A deficiency in young animals,\nespecially when accompanied by a high cereal intake, is degeneration of\nthe central and peripheral nervous systems. In the peripheral system it\nis the afferent nerves which are principally affected, including the\neighth nerve, both cochlear and vestibular divisions. It has now been\npossible to show that vitamin A deficiency produces in young dogs\ndegenerative changes in the ganglia, nerves and organs of both hearing\nand balance inside the temporal bone. All degrees of degeneration have\nbeen produced, from slight degeneration to complete disappearance of\nthe hearing nerve. The nerves and ganglion cells supplying the organ of\nCorti are more easily damaged than those of the vestibular division. As\nmight be expected when once the spiral ganglion cells have disappeared,\nadditions of vitamin A to the diet have no effect, and the organ of\nCorti remains completely denervated. The \"inattention\" of dogs on these\ndiets which I previously ascribed to cerebral defect is undoubtedly due\nto deafness. It now remains to determine whether these results may be\nextended to explain certain forms of deafness in man.The serious effects of deficiency in vitamin A on pregnant rats\nhas been investigated and reported by Mason(6)as follows:Abnormalities are described in the pregnancies\nof rats maintained on diets deficient in vitamin A in varying degree.\nProlongation of the gestation period up to 26 days in severe cases and\na long and difficult labour which might last 2 days and often resulted\nin death of both mother and young were characteristic.Defects due to deficiencies in vitamin A in the diet of dairy\nanimals, (pregnant cows, their offspring and normal calves fed on the\nmilk from those cows) have been reported upon by Meigs and Converse(7)as follows:In 1932 we reported from Beltsville evidence\nthat farm rations frequently fed to calves may be dangerously low in\nvitamin A, and that milk produced by cows fed hay which has lost its\ngreen color may be an unsafe source of vitamin A in the calf ration.\nThis preliminary paper reported results dealing with four cows which\nhad been fed over two years on a good grain mixture and late-cut\nlow-color timothy hay. Of six calves born of these cows, two were dead,\none was unable to stand and died shortly after birth, and three were\nboth weak and blind. The fact that cows so fed were unable to properly\nnourish their calves before birth led to the question whether the milk\nfrom these cows might not be deficient for normal growth of calves from\nother cows fed on rations adequate in vitamin A. This preliminary\nreport included results on three normal calves fed milk from those cows\nfed low-color timothy hay. The three calves died at fifty-seven,\nsixty-two, and seventy-one days of age, respectively.Since growth, prenatal and postnatal, is related directly to the\npituitary body, we are specially interested in the knowledge available\non the functioning of this gland.The work of Barrie(8)throws important light on this subject.\nHe has reported as follows:Partial deficiency of vitamin E as shown in the\nfemale rat fed on a diet containing only a trace of vitamin E but which\nis otherwise complete, results in the prolongation of gestation, which\nmay be continued as long as 10 days beyond the normal period. The\noffspring under these conditions are abnormal. These young may develop\nslowly and be thin and undersized in spite of sufficiently profuse\nlactation, or they may become extremely fat and develop a leg weakness\nand carpopedal spasm about 18 days after birth. Animals of both types\nhave thin skulls and short silky fur. Complete E deficiency in the\nadult also produces the soft fur and imperfectly calcified skull.\nPartially E deficient animals occasionally give birth to a litter but\nfail to lactate.The changes observed are similar in several ways\nto those produced by hypophysectomy (surgical removal of pituitary\ngland). Marked degranulation of the anterior pituitary is found in both\nthe abnormal young and the adult sterile animals. Lack of vitamin E\ntherefore produces a virtual nutritional hypophysectomy in the young\nrat.The inability of various species to complete gestation when\nvitamin E is not provided in adequate quantity has been reported by\nmany investigators. A. L. Bacharach, E. Allehorne and H. E. Glynn have\nused their study of this factor as a means of estimating the quantity\nof vitamin E in the diet.(9)They state:A diet suitable for work on vitamin E causes female rats, fed on\nthis diet from weaning, to show a gestation-resorption rate not\nsignificantly differing from 100 per cent; when the diet is\nsupplemented with adequate amounts of vitamin E, also administered from\nweaning, the live litter rate does not differ significantly from 100\nper cent. It is found that, on such a diet, the percentage of\nimplantations (conceptions) is markedly different between animals that\nhave been submitted to a single gestation-resorption, owing to lack of\nvitamin E, and animals that are mated for the first time. The authors\nsuggest that the process of undergoing gestation-resorption brings\nabout some deep-seated changes in the reproductive mechanism of the\nrat, of a kind not hitherto recognized as characterising the vitamin E\ndeficiency syndrome.One of the outstanding changes which I have found takes place in\nthe primitive races at their point of contact with our modern\ncivilization is a decrease in the ease and efficiency of the birth\nprocess. When I visited the Six Nation Reservation at Brantford,\nOntario, I was told by the physician in charge that a change of this\nkind had occurred during the period of his administration, which had\ncovered twenty-eight years and that the hospital was now used largely\nto care for young Indian women during abnormal childbirth (Chapter\n6).A similar impressive comment was made to me by Dr. Romig, the\nsuperintendent of the government hospital for Eskimos and Indians at\nAnchorage, Alaska. He stated that in his thirty-six years among the\nEskimos, he had never been able to arrive in time to see a normal birth\nby a primitive Eskimo woman. But conditions have changed materially\nwith the new generation of Eskimo girls, born after their parents began\nto use foods of modern civilization. Many of them are carried to his\nhospital after they had been in labour for several days. One Eskimo\nwoman who had married twice, her last husband being a white man,\nreported to Dr. Romig and myself that she had given birth to twentysix\nchildren and that several of them had been born during the night and\nthat she had not bothered to waken her husband, but had introduced him\nto the new baby in the morning.Sherman,(10)who has made many important\ncontributions to our knowledge of vitamin A, has shown in a recent\ncommunication that an amount of vitamin A sufficient to support normal\ngrowth and maintain every appearance of good health in animals, may\nstill be insufficient to meet the added nutritive demands of successful\nreproduction and lactation. With the failure to reproduce successfully,\nthere usually appears in early adult life an increased susceptibility\nto infection, and particularly a tendency to lung disease at an age\ncorresponding to that at which pulmonary tuberculosis so often develops\nin young men and women. He states, further, that vitamin A must be\nsupplied in liberal proportions not only during the growth period but\nduring the adult period as well, if a good condition of nutrition and a\nhigh degree of health and vigor are to be maintained.Hughes, Aubel and Lienhardt(11)have\nshown that a lack of vitamin A in the diets of pigs has resulted in\nextreme incoordination and spasms. They also emphasize that gilts bred\nprior to the onset of the nervous symptoms either aborted or farrowed\ndead pigs.Hart and Gilbert(12)have shown that the\nsymptoms most commonly seen in cattle having a vitamin A deficiency are\nthe birth of dead or weak calves, with or without eye lesions. They\nreport also a condition of newborn calves which simulates white scours,\nand the development of eye lesions in immature animals.Hughes(13has shown that swine did not\nreproduce when fed barley and salt, but did so when cod liver oil was\nadded to this food.Sure(14)has shown that a lack of\nvitamin A produces in females a disturbance in oestrus and ovulation,\nresulting in sterility. Further, he states, that resorption of the\nfetus may be produced by lack of vitamin A, even on a diet containing\nan abundance of vitamin E, which is known as the anti-sterility\nvitamin.One of the most important contributions in this field has been\nmade by Professor Fred Hale, of the Texas Agricultural Experiment\nStation, at College Station, Texas. He has shown that many physical\ndeformities are readily produced by curtailing the amount of vitamin A\nin the ration of pigs. He produced fifty-nine pigs(15)that were born blind, every pig in each of six\nlitters-where the mothers were deprived of vitamin A for several months\nbefore mating and for thirty days thereafter. In pigs, the eyeballs are\nformed in the first thirty days. He found, as have several others, that\ndepriving pigs of vitamin A for a sufficient period produced severe\nnerve involvements including paralysis and spasms, so that the animals\ncould not rise to their feet. He reported that one of these vitamin A\ndeficient pigs that had previously farrowed a litter of ten pigs, all\nborn without eyeballs, was given a single dose of cod liver oil two\nweeks before mating. She farrowed fourteen pigs which showed various\ncombinations of eye defects, some had no eyes, some had one eye, and\nsome had one large eye and one small eye, but all were blind.FIG. 117. Above, this pig was\none of fifty-nine born without eyeballs and with other serious\ndeformities due to lack of vitamin A in the mother's diet. Offspring of\nthese blind pigs when normally fed had perfect eyes and no deformities.\nBelow, A, at left shows normal eye of a pig at nine months. B, at right\nshows partial eyeballs and optic nerves produced in offspring when one\ndose of vitamin A was given two weeks before mating. (Courtesy of\nProfessor Fred Hale.)In Fig. 117 I am able through Professor Hale's kindness, to show\nan eyeless pig and a normal eye of a pig (at the left) and (at the\nright) a pair of incomplete eyes from a pig born in the litter just\nmentioned. This one dose of vitamin A made possible the partial\nformation of optic nerves and eyeballs. A typical eyeless pig is shown\nin Fig. 118 (lower). Note its deformed ears. Among the many physical\ninjuries which develop in the pigs born to sows fed on a diet deficient\nin vitamin A are serious defects of the snout, dental arches, eyes and\nfeet. This pig was born without eyeballs. It also had club feet and two\ntumors. In Fig. 118 (upper right) is shown a pig with cleft palate, and\nin Fig. 119 (upper right) one with double hairlip. In Fig. 118 (upper\nleft) is shown a boy with cleft palate and defective eyes. One of the\nvery important results of Professor Hale's investigations has been the\nproduction of pigs with normal eyes, born to parents both of whom had\nno eyeballs due to lack of vitamin A in their mother's diet. The\nproblem clearly was not heredity. Two litters, one containing nine pigs\nand the other eight, which were born to mothers that had been deprived\nof vitamin A before mating and for thirty days thereafter, produced the\nfollowing lesions: All had complete absence of eyeballs; some lacked\ndevelopment of the opening of the external ear; others had cleft\npalate, harelip, displaced kidneys, displaced ovaries, or displaced\ntestes.FIG. 118. Upper left: Boy has\ncleft palate, and harelip. Upper right: Pig has cleft palate, no eyes.\nBelow, Pig has club feet, deformities of the ears, two tumors and no\neyeballs due to lack of adequate vitamin A in the mother's diet.\n(Kindness of Professor Hale.)FIG. 119. Many young of modern\ndomestic animals are born with deformities. At the upper left is seen a\npup with cleft palate. In two previous litters all the pups were\ndeformed and unable to live. At the upper right is one of Professor\nHale's pigs with double harelip. Below two blind lambs and one with\nclub foot.It is of interest that in October, 1935, Professor Hale reports\nthat the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station was informed that a\nlitter of fourteen pigs had been born blind in June, 1935, on a farm at\nRalls, Texas. Of these, six pigs were raised and brought to the Station\nfor further study. The farmer owning the pigs stated that no green feed\nwas available on his farm from March, 1934, until May, 1935. It will be\nnoted that this condition paralleled the experimental conditions at the\nstation under which by restricting vitamin A before and immediately\nafter gestation fifty-nine pigs were produced without eyeballs.Professor Hale reports that in April, 1935, a litter of seven\npigs were born blind at McGlean, Texas, which was suffering from\ndrought conditions, similar to those at Ralls. The litter and dam were\npurchased by the Experimental Station. Matings were made between blind\npigs. These were fed rations containing ample vitamin A, and normal\npigs with normal eyeballs were produced. Even the mating of a blind son\nwith his mother who had produced him when on deficient diet, produced\nonly normal pigs when both had ample vitamin A. He states, \"If an\nhereditary factor had been the cause of this congenital blindness,\nthese matings would have produced some blind pigs, even if vitamin A\nwere present in the ration.\" The problem of congenital cleft palate has\nbeen very embarrassing to those parents whose children have been so\nafflicted. It is of interest that breeders of fancy dogs are frequently\nembarrassed by having this problem develop in their kennels or among\nlitters born to parent stock obtained from their kennels.In Fig. 119 (upper left) I have shown a water spaniel pup with\ncleft palate. This pup was not able to nurse because of the\nimpossibility of producing suction without a palate. When fed\nartificially the milk was expelled through the nostrils. The mother had\ngiven birth to two previous litters all of which were dead at birth or\ndied soon after. Her diet had been reinforced with mineral calcium\nphosphate in tablet form hoping to insure normal offspring. This is not\nnature's method.I am informed by a veterinary that he has experienced trouble\nwith harelip, cleft palate or serious facial deformities among dogs\nthat are pets in homes where they are lavishly coddled and fed the\nthings they like best. He stated that he has more trouble with head\ndefects in bulldog pups than any other breed.There are few if any problems connected with modern degeneration\non which so much light is thrown as that supplied by recent\ninvestigations on the problems of paternal responsibility for defects\nin the offspring. There are several reasons for this. Because the\nmother has the sole responsibility for the nourishment of the fetus\nduring the formative period and she alone provides the handicaps\nincident to the process of birth, it is very natural that defects are\npractically all interpreted as being associated with these processes.\nThis unfortunately, has been embarrassed further by the fact that since\ndistortions in behavior do not appear until sometime after birth,\nnormality was largely assumed to be present up to the time of their\nappearance, and therefore of necessity would be contributions from the\nchild's environment. As such they would be subject naturally to\ntreatment by applying influences to change the mental environment.\nHence the entire problem of the role of the sex cells through\ncontrolling the architecture of the body including the brain has been\nlargely overlooked. Very important light is thrown on this problem in\nthe data provided on the pup shown in Fig. 120. This shows a dachshund\npup with cleft palate and a very severe spinal deformity. This is not\nunlike deformities frequently seen, or unlike that of the pup shown in\nFig. 119. The highly significant circumstance is the fact that these\nsame deformities not only appeared also in another pup of this same\nlitter but in one pup in each of three other litters about the same\ntime. While four mothers were involved these four litters were all\nsired by one father. The paternal responsibility is clearly\nestablished.FIG. 120. This pup had cleft\npalate, as seen above, and grossly deformed spine, as shown below. It\nwas one of two pups born in the same litter with the same defects and\none of five pups born in four litters with these same defects. Five\ndifferent mother dogs were involved but all pups were from the same\nfather dog.At the right in Fig. 119 a lamb is shown with club feet and two\nlambs without eyeballs. I am told that in some of the sheep raising\nstates quite a number of deformities occur in lambs at birth. One\nwriter states:These deformities may maintain themselves in any\nnumber of ways. We have them two-headed, 5 and 6 legs, 2 tails, born\nwithout eyes, hermaphrodites, born with ribs on one side and any number\nof such deformities. A common deformity in sheep is under-shot and\nover-shot jaws. This simply means that the upper jaw extends farther to\nthe front that the under jaw and the front teeth do not meet. This is\ncalled over-shot and the reverse is called under-shot.It will be noted that a common deformity in sheep relates to an\nunder-development of either the upper or lower jaw which is one of the\nmost common expressions of disturbed development in humans.Some illustrations of the deformities that may occur in domestic\nanimals are shown in Fig. 121. Above are seen two cows each with an\nextra foreleg attached to the shoulder; below, to the left is shown a\ndouble-faced calf which also had a cleft palate; to the right a cat\nwith deformed legs.FIG. 121. Typical deformities\nin domestic animals. Above, two cows with an extra foreleg hanging from\nthe shoulder. Below, left, double faced calf. Right, cat with deformed\nlegs.In corresponding with Professor Hale, I inquired whether they\nhad information as to the effect of vitamin A deficiency on the sire.\nHe replied, \"If we reduceed the vitamin A content of the body of the\nsire, he would become sterile and, therefore, we could not try this\nprocedure.\" The question arises as to what the effect would be of a\nless severe depletion of vitamin A of both parents.It is a very easy matter to place the full responsibility on the\nmother, when defects develop in the children. These data indicate that\neither parent may contribute directly to certain of the defects of the\nchildren, due to defects in the germ plasm.A practical case from my field studies includes a full-blooded\nEskimo woman who was married twice, the second time to a white man, by\nwhom she had several children. She had insisted on selecting and\npreparing the native foods for herself, though she prepared the white\nman's imported foods for him. With a total of twenty-six pregnancies\nshe did not have any tooth decay. He had rampant tooth decay, and a\nmarked abnormality in the development of face and of the dental arches.\nSeveral of the children had incomplete development of the face and of\nthe dental arches. One of the girls who was married had very narrow\ndental arches and nostrils and a typical boyish type of body build.\nUnlike her mother, this girl had a very severe experience in the birth\nof her only child and insisted that she would not take the risk of\nhaving another. Several daughters have narrow arches. The question\narises whether the deficient nutrition of the father may have been the\ncontributing factor in the injury of their children.New light is being thrown on human problems by animal\ninvestigations. One study that is particularly instructive has been\nconducted by McKenzie and Berliner of the University of Missouri.\n(Bulletin No. 265.) The experimental animals used were sheep. Their\nstudies indicated to them that they could predict the level of\nfertility of the sire by studies made on the seminal fluid. They found\nthat the percentage of abnormal spermatozoa increased to 84 per cent\nunder unfavorable conditions and reduced to less than 15 per cent under\nfavorable conditions. When the unfavorable conditions characterized by\nthese abnormal spermatozoa prevailed the females did not conceive. High\ntemperature proved to be an important controlling factor as indicated\nby variation in percentage of abnormal sperm. In one breed the average\nvariation was from 2.5 per cent in January to 22 per cent defective in\nAugust; in another breed from 18 per cent in January to 73 per cent\ndefective in August. They also found that the same result could be\nproduced in the winter by keeping the sires in heated rooms or by\napplying heat externally. They further found that when the percentage\nof abnormal sperm was high a condition of sterility was apparently\nestablished. In a personal communication from Professor McKenzie he\nstates that their inference is that with a high percentage of abnormal\nsperm the ova either are not fertilized or that fertilization takes\nplace and that prenatal death occurs in a certain number of the cases,\nand that there is an appreciable prenatal death loss in sheep, horses,\ncattle, and swine. I have referred to the data presented by Mall\nindicating that 15 per cent of human conceptions in England are\nexpelled as deformities in the second and third month of gestation.\nMcKenzie also presents data relating to swine in which a sire that\nshowed a high percentage of abnormal sperm was bred to two groups of\nsows of similar breed. One was maintained in a barn without access to\npasture, the other received similar rations plus access to pasture. The\ngroup without pasture produced a high percentage of mummies, small\nlitters, and abnormal pigs (open abdominal walls with viscera\nprotruding and exposed spine in the region of the lumbar vertebrae).\nThe second group on the same food with the addition of pasturage\nproduced normally large-size litters without mummies. The following\nyear this experiment was repeated reversing the groups of sows and\nusing a similar high percentage of defective sperm in the same sire.\nThe same results occurred, with the group maintained without access to\npasture. This emphasizes the need for the vitamins and minerals that\nare provided in natural foods, particularly vitamin A and seems to\nrelate to the studies of Hale in which the absence of vitamin A\nproduced gross defects. These studies on domestic animals strongly\nemphasize the necessity that both parents shall have adequate nutrition\nbefore conception occurs and subsequently for the mother.Until very recently there has been exceedingly little literature\ndealing with the factors contributing to the abnormal development of\nfetuses in either domestic animals or humans. Williams, who is one of\nthe few students of this problem as it relates to domestic animals, in\nreferring to this phase has commented that there is no treatise in the\nEnglish language on teratology (development of monsters) in domestic\nanimals.(16)He emphasizes that these defects\nare growing in numbers and economic importance. He refers to Burki's\nstudies in Switzerland indicating that this difficulty has constantly\nand enormously increased in his territory. This veterinary has asked\n\"Are our cows degenerating?\" It is of interest that a type of deformity\ncommonly recognized among veterinaries as a distortion of the head\npresenting a lack of development of the bones of the middle part of the\nface including the upper jaw is commonly called \"bull-dog calf.\" This\nis particularly important in connection with the frequent human\ndeficiency of lack of development in the middle third of the face.\nWilliams emphasizes the common knowledge that Boston bull-dogs are not\nprolific and because of the difficulty of giving birth to their young,\nsome veterinarians resort routinely to caesarian section. Fortunately,\nseriously deformed specimens are seldom born alive and usually do not\ncontinue to term. Williams states that Loje has observed ten grossly\ndeformed calves of a particular type that were traced to the same sire;\nalso a series of five with this deformity reported by Hutt were traced\nto one sire. Among the deformities in domestic animals cleft palate or\nabsence of palate is very common. These studies on domestic animals\nstrongly emphasize two facts; first, that deformities among these\nanimals are very similar to those that develop in humans, and second,\nthat the defects are largely related to the original germ cells and\nthat the male may provide the defect quite as well as the female.\nSeveral of the primitive races have understood and provided against\nthese mishaps.Moench and Holt of the Cornell Medical School and New York\nHospital(17)have made important studies on\nhumans and have found a very high incidence of sterility when abnormal\nforms of spermatozoa reached 25 per cent. Among the abnormal forms they\nfound one particular family with a particular type of abnormal sperm\nreaching 12 per cent. Their breeding record was decidedly bad and fetal\nmalformations repeatedly occurred. In their group, in 63 sterile\nmatings the men were normal 21 times and abnormal 37 times. They listed\nover 40 different abnormal or deformed types of sperm. They\nconclude:In a normal semen the abnormal sperm heads do not\nexceed 19 to 20 per cent.When the sperm head abnormalities reach 20 to 23\nper cent, impaired fertility can be assumed.When the sperm head abnormalities are above 25 per\ncent, clinical sterility is usually present.An important contribution to the question of the relation of the\ngerm cells of the father to the type of defects that are prevalent in\nhis family history has been made in recent studies conducted in\nGermany.(18)Two German surgeons concerned with enforcing the\nsterilization law in Berlin have taken advantage of their opportunities\nto make an important contribution to the study of fecundity.Several studies have been published previously,\nof the spermatozoa of normal men. This book offers a study of the\nspermatozoa of men who had been diagnosed as hereditarily defective. At\nthe time of the operation, the upper part of the vas deferens was\nwashed out, and the sperm thus obtained were studied in great detail,\n20 different types of abnormality being distinguished.In their control studied, the normal man is\nfound to produce 19 per cent of morphologically defective sperm. By\ncontrast, the chronic alcoholic patient produces 75 per cent of\ndefective sperm.Previously it has been assumed that as much as\n25 per cent or 30 per cent of abnormal sperm were a good evidence of\nlowered fertility if not of sterility. But the fertility of these\nchronic alcoholics was not diminished, the authors claim.In cases of inherited mental defect, 62 per cent\nof abnormal sperm were produced, accompanied by low fecundity,--as is\nthe case generally with the mentally defective male. On the other hand,\nin hereditary deafness, 62 per cent and in hereditary blindness 75 per\ncent of defective sperm appeared.Epilepsy and schizophrenia (dementia praecox)\nboth supposed to be constitutional in origin, show less abnormality of\nspermatozoa (58 per cent and 54 per cent respectively) than blindness\nand deafness.The fact that in the past almost the entire emphasis of change\nin physical, mental and moral qualities has been assigned to the forces\nof heredity, strongly emphasizes the lack of information regarding the\nnature of the forces at work and the points at which their influence\nconstitute the determining factors. The data previously presented in\nthis chapter dealing with the role of vitamins A and E throw valuable\nnew light on this phase. It is important, however, that new data are\navailable dealing with the factors which injure the germ cells and\nwhich Tredgold has spoken of as \"poisoned germ cells.\"In a personal communication received from Professor T. S. Sutton\nof the College of Agriculture, Ohio State University, he makes the\nfollowing observation:For several years we have been interested in the\nstudy of the effects of vitamin A deficiency. Right now our main\nconsideration is the effect of this deficiency on reproduction. We find\nthat a diet low in vitamin A will cause reproductive failure, which\nseems to be caused chiefly by a degeneration of the germinal epithelium\nof the gonad. This is particularly true in the case of the male. I\nthink we have rather convincing evidence that this is a direct dietary\ndamage to the gonad (ovary or testis), rather than a disruption of the\nendocrine balance which might result in sterility as appears to be the\ncase in vitamin B deficiency.The degenerative processes which occur in nerve tissues due to\nvitamin A deficiency have been studied by Professor Sutton and his\nassociates.(19)They have been able to show\ndetailed progressive degeneration within nerve fibers as a result of\nvitamin A deficiency.In the light of the newer information it is quite clear why we\nmay have anyone of the following distinct expressions in the\nreproductive process, namely, physical excellence of succeeding\ngenerations (such as obtains among many of the primitive races as I\nhave shown); complete reproductive failure or sterility or partial\nfailure resulting in defectives of various types at the borderline\nbetween these two phases. It is the rapid and progressive increase in\nthis last group which constitutes the progressive degeneration of our\nmodern civilization.One of the main problems in this study has to do with the\nrelation of nutrition to the modification of the growth of the child,\nboth in its formative period and in the stage of adolescence. I have\nshown that in many of these primitive racial stocks there occurs in the\nfirst generation after the displacement of native foods by imported\nfoods a marked change in facial and dental arch forms. These changes\nhappen most frequently in the later children in the families and come\nabout notwithstanding the impact of heredity through all the previous\ngenerations of excellent physical development. Clinically, the evidence\nis abundant, that this change occurs in these primitive racial stocks\nregardless of color, geographic location, temperature, and climate. We\nare apparently dealing here with a factor which, while it may be\nrelated to the germ plasm and to the prenatal growth period, clearly\ninvolves other forces than those that are at work in the case of\nhereditary defectives. Since these changes have to do directly with\ndisturbances in growth of the head, particularly of the face and of the\ndental arches, we are concerned with such evidence as may be available\nas to the nature of the forces that readily affect the anatomy of the\nskull.The general architecture of the body is apparently determined\nprimarily by the health of the two germ cells at the time of their\nunion. This architectural design may not be completely fulfilled due to\ninterference with nutritive processes both before and after birth. In\nthis large problem of the relationship between physical design of the\nbody and resistance or susceptibility to disease, we may have\ndetermining factors operating at different periods in prenatal and\npostnatal growth. The accumulating evidence strongly emphasizes that\ndisease susceptibility is a widely variable factor and associated with\ncertain types of developmental disturbances.In a discussion of tuberculosis susceptibility before a meeting\nof specialists in that field, emphasis was placed upon the fact that\nother factors than the bacteria played controlling roles in the matter\nof susceptibility to tuberculosis.Weisman has recently made an important contribution to the\nproblem of physical development and susceptibility to tuberculosis. He\nhas presented(20)statistical data indicating\nthe type of chest deformity which predisposes an individual to\ntuberculosis. He states:In a study previously made on the shape of the\nnormal and of the tuberculosis chest, it was found that the average\nnormal chest was flat and wide and that the average tuberculous chest\nwas deep and narrow. It was also shown that the deep chest was an\nunderdeveloped, primitive type of chest, resembling an infant's chest\nin shape. Later studies on the shape of the chest and on environment\nshowed that children from the poorer socio-economic environments had on\nthe average a deeper chest, weighed less and were shorter than the\nchildren from the higher socio-economic levels. An investigation\nrecently made on the incidence of tuberculosis in the various school\ndistricts in Minneapolis revealed that there is a very high incidence\nof tuberculosis among the children from the slums where the deep chest\nprevails. Ten times as many cases of tuberculosis were reported from a\nschool district which is perhaps the poorest in the city as were\nreported from the best school districts.This study, which shows that there is a definite\ncorrelation between the deep chest and the positive reaction to\ntuberculin adds one more link to the chain of evidence supporting the\ncontention that the deep chest is more or less associated with\ntuberculosis. It also helps to explain why there is such a high\nincidence of tuberculosis among the poor in the slum districts. The\nchildren in the slums are physically underdeveloped. They are not only\nshorter and lighter but they have on the average a deep, primitive,\ninfantile type of chest, one that has not gone through the normal\nprocess of development. Even the new-born and infants are shorter and\nlighter and have a deeper chest than the average infant from a better\nenvironment.It is important to note that Dr. Weisman associated the type of\nchest which predisposes the individual to tuberculosis, with a prenatal\ncondition since he states \"even the new-born and infants are shorter\nand lighter and have a deeper chest than an average infant from a\nbetter environment.\" This work throws important light on why in the\nprimitive groups the children born to parents who are living on the\nimported nutrition lower in vitamins and minerals than the native\nfoods, not only showed a greatly increased incidence of tuberculosis\nover the children born to parents on the native diet but also proved to\nbe those individuals who, in facial and dental arch form, presented\npositive evidence of prenatal injury. We also have a direct explanation\nfor the observations that have been emphasized by Dr. George Draper,\nthat physical form has a direct relationship to disease susceptibility\nof certain types, frequently spoken of as diatheses.It is important in this connection to call to mind the statement\nmade by some clinicians that tuberculosis patients with narrow nostrils\ntend to make a poor fight. These narrow nostrils are clearly related to\nprenatal injury resulting primarily from defective germ cells which\ndetermine the architecture, not heredity but intercepted heredity.It is very easy to understand the effects of gross physical\nlesions such as the absence of eyeballs, harelip and cleft palate.\nThese defects can readily be seen. The problem is very different,\nhowever, when we are dealing with disturbances of function due to\nminute anatomical lesions in either external or internal organs such as\nthe brain. These latter will be discussed in the next chapter.REFERENCESPRICE, W. A. Dental Infections. Cleveland, Penton, 1923.DRAPER, G. Human Constitution. Phila., Saunders, 1924.DRAPER, G.

Few, if any, of the problems which confront\nmodern civilization are more serious and disturbing than the\nprogressive increase in the percentage of individuals with unsocial\ntraits and a lack of irresponsibility.Laird(1)has emphasized some phases of\nthis in an article entitled,The Tail That Wags the Nation,in\nwhich he states: \"The country's average level of general ability sinks\nlower with each generation. Should the ballot be restricted to citizens\nable to take care of themselves? One out of four cannot.\" He has\nillustrated the seriousness of this degeneration by presenting details\nas follows:Although we might cite any one of nearly two\ndozen states, we will first mention Vermont by name because that is the\nplace studied by the late Dr. Pearce Bailey. \"It would be,\" he wrote,\n\"safe to assume that there are at least 30 defectives per 1000 in\nVermont of the eight-year-old mentality type, and 300 per 1000 of\nbackward or retarded persons, persons of distinctly inferior\nintelligence. In other words, nearly one-third of the whole population\nof that state is of a type to require some supervision.From a broad view of the problem of modern degeneration it will\nbe helpful to note the observations by Tredgold(2)in mental deficiency. He states:It is thus evident that the condition of mental\ndeficiency, whilst presenting many interesting problems to the\nphysician, the pathologist, and the psychologist, has also a much wider\ninterest and importance. Since in Man the predominate feature is Mind,\nand since it is by its development and evolution that human progress\nhas taken, and must take place, it is clear that the question of its\ndisease, and particularly of its defect, is one of supreme importance\nto the statesman, the sociologist, the philosopher, and the whole\ncommunity.In connection with these investigations among primitive races it\nis interesting to note that the data are in complete harmony with the\ndata which clinical pathologists, clinicians and anatomists have\nobtained in their study of the physical and structural characteristics\nof individuals who make up the deficiency groups. In discussing the\nproblem of the significance of the shape of the palate, Tredgold(2)states:Palate--The association of abnormalities of the\npalate with mental deficiency has long been recognized, and there is no\ndoubt that it is one of the commonest malformations occurring in this\ncondition. Many years ago Langdon Down drew attention to the subject,\nand more recently Clouston has recorded a large number of observations\nwhich show conclusively that, although deformed palates occur in the\nnormal, they are far and away more frequent in neuropaths and the\nmentally defective. He states that deformed palates are present in 19\nper cent of the ordinary population, 33 per cent of the insane, 55 per\ncent of criminals, but in no less than 61 per cent of idiots. Petersen,\nwho has made a most exhaustive study of this question, and has compiled\nan elaborate classification of the various anomalies found palatal\ndeformities present in no less than 82 per cent of aments, (mental\ndefectives), in 76 per cent of epileptics, and in 80 per cent of the\ninsane.Probably every city in the United States has made special\nprovision for both mentally deficient groups and unsocial individuals,\neither in special schools or in special classes. In Cleveland, we have\nhad a large school devoted to the problems of the so-called\npre-delinquent boys, of whom nearly all have been before the courts and\nare assigned to this institution because they are not well enough\nadjusted to be kept in their normal school environment. In discussing\nthe characteristics of these boys with the principal of that school, I\nasked him what the probabilities were that many of these boys would\nfinally become involved in crime. His comment was, in effect, that they\nwere virtually in the vestibule of a penal institute, when judged by\nthe experience of previous boys from that school.In approaching a study of this group, it is helpful to observe\nthe experience of the well-equipped institutions organized for the\ncorrection of the abnormal trend which characterizes these boys. In\nthis connection, there is a helpful report by the United States Dept.\nof Labor, Publication No. 203, which gives the result of tracing the\nafter careers of 621 boys who were in five of the best-known\ncorrectional institutions. It was found that 66 per cent had been\narrested and 58 per cent convicted one or more times after having been\nparoled from the institution. It is apparent from data of this type\nthat probably the forces that produce these abnormal expressions cause\nirreparable damage in the brain tissue. Practically all recent crime\nreports are recording an increase in juvenile crime. The Children's\nBureau of the Dept. of Labor stated (Nov. 4, 1938): \"that juvenile\ndelinquency spurted during 1937 for the first time since 1930,\" but it\ncannot explain why until further study.Reports to the bureau from 28 courts in 17 states and the\nDistrict of Columbia showed that they handled 31,038 cases during 1937,\nan increase of 3,000 over 1936. The report showed that 44 per cent of\nthe cases involved children between 14 and 15 years old; 22 per cent\nthose between 12 and 13 years, and 10 per cent those between 10 and 11.\nBoys' cases comprised 8 5 per cent of the total.As an approach to this problem I have made an examination of 189\nboys in the Cleveland school for pre-delinquents. I gave particular\nattention to those physical signs of nutritional injury, which seemed\nto be definitely assigned to the formative period of the child. We\nendeavored to obtain detailed information relative to the family\nhistory and to the birth of the child. We were fortunate in having the\nassistance of the officers, and of a nurse in the dental service of the\nHealth Department of the Board of Education, a nurse who made visits to\nthe homes of many of these boys to obtain the information directly from\nthe mothers.In this group of boys, there were twenty-nine for whom I had not\nsufficient details to include their cases in the studies. Of the 189 in\nthe group, there were only three with sufficiently normal dental arches\nto be classified as normal. Accordingly, 98.4 per cent proved to be\nindividuals with more or less marked abnormality. Many of the faces\nwere very badly deformed.While often it will be difficult to place the responsibility\nentirely on either parent for the child's abnormal physical\ndevelopment, it is of interest to study the birth rank of these\nchildren. The average number of children in the families represented by\nthese 160 children is 4.75. Of these, thirty-five, or 21.9 per cent,\nare first children in the families represented; thirteen, or 9.1 per\ncent, are only children; thirty-nine, or 24.4 per cent, are last\nchildren; and thirty-six or 22.5 per cent, are fifth children or later.\nSixty-two, or 38.7 per cent, are either the first or last child. It\nwill be seen from these data that the first or last child, or even a\nlate child in a large family, tended to have a distinctly poorer chance\nthan the intermediate children in the families in which these studies\nwere made. Statistical data relating the age of the mother and father\nto prenatal deficiency of their offspring reveal that abnormally young\nparents have a much higher percentage of defective children than do\nthose in the most favorable child-bearing period of life. The group at\nthe Cleveland school included only those boys who have been before the\ncourts because of more or less serious phases of delinquency. If they\nare in a considerable part the products of a defective society, it\nseems quite unfair that they should be held entirely responsible for\nthat delinquency, which has put them in this institution. If they are\ndestined for a penal institute in which they will be held entirely\nresponsible for that abnormality which resulted in their misdemeanor,\nas has been the procedure in the past, are they receiving just\nconsideration? Society may be justified in protecting itself from their\nmisdeeds by placing restrictions about them, but it does not seem that\nsociety is justified in shifting the entire responsibility to the\naffected individuals.Recent studies of the mental capacity of felons brought before\nthe Common Pleas Court in Cleveland have shown that of 3,197 convicted\nfelons examined in the medical clinic only 42.3 per cent were\nclassified as normal. Fifty-five and nine-tenths per cent were classed\nas defective delinquents and only 1.8 per cent as insane. The outgrowth\nof this study has resulted in the drafting by the Cleveland Bar\nAssociation of a new criminal law for Ohio to be presented to the\ncoming State Legislature. This bill provides for the creation of a new\ncriminal class composed of what are called defective delinquents. This\nincludes morons and others of abnormal mentality but not insane who\ncommit felonies or misdemeanors. The purpose of this legislation is to\nafford special treatment for law violators falling within the new\nclassification, making it possible to segregate delinquents in separate\ninstitutions. The Ohio law like that of most other states now\nrecognizes only two types of criminals, sane and insane, and if not\ninsane they must be punished.It is proper that we should ask who is to blame for the\nabnormalities which render these young men incapable of making the\nnecessary adaptation to our environment.An important characteristic of the boys in the Cleveland school\nwas their low intelligence. Practically all were recorded as retarded\nor mentally backward prior to their transfer to this institution.It is important that we note the characteristics of groups that\nare similarly retarded, but who have not demonstrated sufficiently\nunsocial characters to have to be placed in the pre-delinquent groups.\nWe shall recognize them as individuals who may never commit unsocial\nacts sufficient to get them into trouble, though they will doubtless\ncontinue in the group of mentally backward persons. Such a group is to\nbe found in the Outwaithe School in Cleveland. The children in this\nschool, which enrolls about one thousand students, were examined in\norder to ascertain whether there might be groups that are similarly\nafflicted physically. The school is distinctive because it has a very\nhigh percentage of children who are backward mentally. Many of these\nchildren have been concentrated there in order to bring them under the\ninfluence of special teachers. In an examination of a cross section of\nthe children, almost all were found to have had distinct injury in the\nformative period, as evidenced by the changes in facial form. A\npreliminary survey of the backward children of this institution was\nmade by having typical classes selected by an official of the school\nfrom ages ranging from eleven to seventeen. I examined the arches and\nmade measurements of the head and face. With the assistance of the\nschool nurse I obtained records of the other children in the families\nselected. This latter survey was supplemented by field work by the\nnurse. The intelligence quotients, as reported in the records, were\nalso provided. In the twenty-nine individuals so studied, seven, or\ntwenty-five per cent were first children; fourteen, or fifty per cent\nlast children in the families. Only one individual was found with\napproximately normal dental arches, that is, approximately three per\ncent of the individuals. Twenty-eight children, or 97 per cent, had\nabnormality of one or both dental arches. These children were placed in\nthis institution because they were backward mentally, although as a\ngroup they are comparable to the group studied in the Thomas A. Edison\nSchool, where the grouping was based on delinquent traits. A cursory\nexamination was made by observing other pupils in this school in their\nclasses and on the grounds. A large percentage of severe facial and\ndental arch deformities and a very high percentage with definite\ndisturbances in facial growth were evident. These data are presented as\napplying to a group of individuals characterized by a disturbed\nmentality, to the extent that they were assigned to special classes for\nthe mentally retarded. While the group constituting the school\npopulation at Outwaithe represented the relatively large group of\npupils assigned to special classes for backward children and did not\ncarry the stigmata of delinquency carried by those of the Thomas A.\nEdison School, both groups had many physical defects in common.We are, accordingly, concerned with the relationship existing\namong various stages of mental backwardness, pre-delinquency and\ncriminality. To throw light on this subject, I visited our State\nPenitentiary to observe the characteristics of facial and dental arch\ndevelopment of the individuals whose unsocial traits had brought them\nto this institution. I visited the dental clinic with the director, Dr.\nMay, and saw the mouths of typical members of that colony as they were\npresented for oral examination. I asked the director what, if any,\nspecial features of the oral cavity he had observed to be\ncharacteristic of this group and different from those he had observed\noutside the institution in his private practice. He stated that he had\nnoted continually that there was a tendency for the tongue to be too\nlarge for the mouth. This is a constant characteristic of another group\nof mentally injured, namely, the Mongoloid. This institution has a\npopulation of approximately four thousand individuals. A high\npercentage of them gave marked evidence of injury in the prenatal\nperiod as expressed in disturbances of facial form and the shape of the\ndental arches. In observing over half the population at work or\nexercise, I did not see one with a typically normal facial development.\nIn Fig. 122 will be seen typical examples of this group. These show\nfront and side views (see Hooton's recent book.15a).FIG. 122. Criminals. Were their\nunsocial traits related directly to incomplete brain organization\nassociated with prenatal injury?Newspaper daily illustrated reports of crimes committed by young\ncriminals show almost continually these evidences of prenatal injury.\nNote the two characters Bird and Nixon, Fig. 123.FIG. 123. Note the marked lack\nof normal facial development of these notorious young criminals. Nixon\nis only 18. These are typical samples seen frequently in the daily\npress.It is important to emphasize the fact that the disturbances in\nthe development of the head, face and brain may have a variety of\nexpressions. In the more severe form characteristic of the Mongoloid\ngroup, as seen in Fig. 124 the facial injury is typical and is\nassociated with a mental disturbance which, in turn, has been shown to\nbe associated with typical brain lesions. The individuals of that\ngroup, however, do not tend to be criminals. Indeed, their injury is\ntoo severe. As a group they are apt to be docile, tractable and happy.\nIndeed, in the mentally backward and criminal groups in their various\nstages, we find facial patterns typical of large numbers of individuals\nwe see on the streets, who are in school or in business, and entirely\ncapable of maintaining a respected and honorable position in society.\nAccordingly, it is not justified, and indeed would be entirely unfair,\nto associate their disturbed facial and dental arch development with\ntraits that would be normally found in the grossly unsocial groups. We\ncannot by viewing the face evaluate the kind or extent of brain injury\nthat is associated with prenatal malnutrition of that individual.\nIndeed, these various divergent facial patterns are accepted by our\nmodern civilization as representative of the many varieties or patterns\nconstituting a normal population. It is not until we see primitive\ngroups living under a controlled natural environment that we see\nNature's model and design of the human physiognomy.FIG. 124. This is a typical\nmongoloid defective. Note the marked lack of development of the middle\nthird of the face and nose with the upper arch too small for the lower.\nIndividuals of this type look alike and act alike and all have typical\nspeech and behavior defects. These are now associated with definite\ndefects in the brain. Nearly all are either a first or last child. A\nlarge percentage are born to mothers over forty years of\nage.We are concerned to know the percentage in any typical colony of\nour modern civilization that may be placed in the various\nclassifications of normal, mildly backward mentally, severely backward\nmentally, unsocial, delinquent, criminal, idiots, epileptic and insane.\nTredgold(2)reports two surveys in England and\nWales which give figures on the proportion of the population that could\nbe identified with definite lesions. It would be fortunate if a survey\ncould be made in the United States that would indicate the extent of\nthe increase in delinquents of various types, including racketeers and\ncriminals. It would be very helpful if these data could be related to\nthe degrees of prenatal injury. There are many phases of modern\ndegeneration which lend themselves to study from the standpoint of the\nprobable role of progressive decline in the efficiency of nutrition to\nthe progressive increase in morbidity, mortality, mental deficiency and\ndelinquency. This is discussed in the next chapter on Soil Depletion,\nPlant and Animal Deterioration.From the point of view of this problem the differences between\nthe modern white civilizations and many of the primitive groups is\ninteresting. Criminal tendencies in isolated primitives are so slight\nthat no prisons are required. I have referred to the Loetschental\nValley in Switzerland, which, until recently, has been physically\nisolated from the process of modernization. For the two thousand\ninhabitants in that valley, there is no prison. In Uganda, Africa, the\nRuanda tribes estimated to number two and a half millions, had no\nprisons.Observation of Nature's normal facial patterns in the primitive\nracial stocks, establishes types within the limits of normality. The\nreaders of this text by observing the individuals in any given families\nmay see in how large a percentage of white families the progressive\nnarrowing and lengthening of the face in the younger members of the\nfamily as compared with the older occurs. Further observations will\nenable one to recognize rapidly, even without experience and special\ntraining in anatomy, these evidences of prenatal injury.I made a survey in the New England States, Quebec and Eastern\nOntario, because the United States death rate from heart disease as\nreported by the American Heart Association was shown to be highest in\nVermont and New Hampshire, followed closely by Massachusetts and New\nYork. I first visited the New York State Hospital for tuberculosis\npatients at Raybrook, near Saranac. With the assistance of a member of\nthe staff, I examined fifty young men and women in the wards. In that\ngroup, only three were found with normal facial and dental arch\ndevelopment. These three individuals were marble cutters who were\nsuffering from silicosis. The forty-seven other individuals examined\n(94 per cent) were found to have marked evidence of injury in the\ndevelopmental period. At the state fair at Rutland, Vermont, to which\nresidents came from various communities throughout the state, I was\nable to count, by observing and recording the individuals who passed,\nthat in each 100 people, three out of four gave evidence of injury in\nthe developmental period. Similar studies were made at the State Farm\nfor delinquent boys and girls, almost all of whom had been before the\ncourts. 1 found that a very high percentage, approximating 100 per cent\nof those observed, had received injuries in the prenatal period. I then\nwent to Quebec and studied groups of school children in the early\nteens. I observed groups in which a very high percentage gave marked\nevidence of prenatal injury. This seemed aggravated in districts where\nthe farms had been abandoned, because the land was not producing as\nwell as in the past. I studied Indians in two Indian Reservations,\nalso, and there again found marked evidence of injury typical of our\nmodernized communities. Similarly, a limestone district in Ontario was\nvisited and critical observations were made of the facial form of the\nnew generation, in regions in which the fertility of the soil had been\ndefinitely depleted through exhaustion. These again showed evidence of\nprenatal injury through faulty nutrition. The prisoners in a jail were\nexamined, and all of them except two habitual drunkards showed marked\nevidence of prenatal injury.If space permitted, it would be interesting to include here a\ndiscussion and illustrations of the physical characteristics of the\nracketeers and criminals whose pictures are shown in our newspapers\nalmost daily. It is rare that a normal face is depicted in this\ngroup.As an approach to more detailed study of the available\ninformation regarding the processes that are involved in the production\nof facial deformities, it will be helpful to think of the face as\nconstituting the floor of the anterior part of the brain. The pituitary\nbody is situated on the underside of the brain just back of the eyes.\nIt is the governing body for the activity of growth, and largely\ncontrols the functioning of several of the other glands of internal\nsecretion. It is, as it were, the master of the ship. We are,\naccordingly, primarily concerned with the role that it plays, and the\nforces which control its own development and function. Its dependence\nupon vitamin E has been demonstrated by many workers. For example, Dr.\nM. M. O. Barrie(3)has reported that an\ninadequate amount of vitamin E produces marked disturbance in the\ngrowth of the offspring of rats. He states:The changes observed are similar in several ways\nto those produced by hypophysectomy (removal of pituitary gland).\nMarked degranulation of the anterior pituitary is found in both the\nabnormal young and the adult sterile animals. Lack of vitamin E\ntherefore produces a virtual nutritional hypophysectomy in the young\nrat.The work recently done in this field by Dr. Hector Mortimer and\nhis associates in McGill University, Montreal, has included studies of\nskull development of rats. He has shown that the surgical removal of\nthe pituitary body at the base of the brain in very young rats produces\nregularly a certain type of defect in skull development. This has been\ncharacterized by a lack of development forward of the muzzle or face,\nwith a narrowing of the nose and dental arches. He found that by the\naddition of extracts made from the pituitary glands, which he had\nremoved surgically, he entirely prevented the development of these\ndefects, thereby establishing the relation of the injury to\ndeficiencies of the hormones developed by that organ. Another approach\nto the problem on which he has expended much fruitful effort, has been\nin connection with the study of the skulls of individuals who are known\nto have disturbances in the functioning of the pituitary gland through\nthe interference caused by tumors. Common illustrations are the cases\nof acromegaly or giantism. By associating these physical changes in\nbodily form with each x-ray, data obtained from skiagraphs, together\nwith the history and the nature of the tumor, considerable information\nhas been developed. Another important series of studies has included\nthe correlation, by means of the x-rays, of the skulls of individuals\nsuffering from certain types of physical and mental disturbances, with\ncertain abnormalities in the skull as shown by the x-rays. By these\nvarious means Dr. Mortimer has been able to divide the various types of\nskull defects and developmental and growth defects into distinct\nclassifications. With this yardstick he is able to classify individuals\nfrom their Roentgenograms. It is of interest that in his work, in\nassociation with Dr. G. Levine, Dr. A. W. Rowe and others at the Evans\nMemorial for Clinical Research and Neuro-Endocrine Research in Boston,\nimportant relationships have been established through the examination\nof over three thousand case histories. X-ray records of the skull are\nincluded in the studies. They report that independent and previous\nphysiological investigations gave evidence at the time of the\nexamination of disturbed pituitary function. Dr. Mortimer's excellent\ninvestigations seem to indicate clearly that facial and dental arch\nform are directly related to and controlled by the functioning of the\npituitary body in the base of the brain. Dr. Barrie(3)reports that partial deficiency of vitamin E, as shown\nin the case of the female rat, results in the prolongation of gestation\nwhich may be continued as long as ten days beyond the normal period.\nThe offspring under these conditions are abnormal. Further, animals\ndeficient in vitamin E, occasionally give birth to a litter, but fail\nto lactate.When we realize that one of the best sources of vitamin E is\nwheat germ, most of which is removed from white flour, usually along\nwith four-fifths of the mineral, we see one cause of the tragedy that\nis overwhelming so many individuals in our modern civilization. In many\nindividuals it may be wise to reinforce our modern white bread and\nstarchy dietary with wheat germ, which can be obtained in package form\nfrom the manufacturers of flour. As this is put up in cans, all air is\ndisplaced with an inert gas when the cans are sealed. While in this way\noxidation of the embryo which is very fragile, is prevented, as soon as\nthe seal is broken, oxidation sets in and progresses rapidly, producing\na product that is not comparable to the wheat embryo of freshly cracked\nwhole wheat. My investigations indicate that Nature has put just the\nright amount of embryo in each grain of wheat to accompany that\nquantity of food. If the whole wheat is prepared and eaten promptly\nafter grinding and exposing the embryo to oxidation, the effect desired\nby Nature is adequately provided.It is important to emphasize in connection with the development\nof the deformities of the face that other skeletal deficiencies or\nabnormalities result from the same disturbing factors. One of these is\nthe narrowing of the entire body, with a tendency to increase in\nheight. This is shown in many of the family groups of modernized\nprimitives. The effect of this narrowing of the body, which in girls\nresults in the boyish type of figure due to the narrowing of the hips,\nintroduces an entirely new and serious problem in the experience of our\nmodern civilization when confronted with the problems of\nchildbirth.Among primitive races living in a primitive state childbirth was\na very simple and rapid process, accompanied by little fear or\napprehension; whereas, in the modernized descendants, even in the first\nand second generations of those individuals born to parents after they\nhad adopted the foods of modern white civilizations, serious trouble\nwas often experienced.We have been considering the changes which take place in the\nskeletal growth as a result of the disturbances in the functioning of\nthe pituitary body of the individual after birth, or of the mother\nduring the prenatal period. We are also concerned with changes in the\nsoft tissues, particularly the brain. I have presented data indicating\nthat a very large percentage of mentally backward children have\ndisturbances in facial development. The available data also indicate\nthat a large percentage of those who are seriously injured in facial\nform have some disturbance in their mental or moral character. Whether\nthere is relationship between the processes which develop these\nphysical abnormalities in brain growth and mental efficiency, including\nemotional states and character traits is now to be considered.An important contribution has been made to this phase of the\nproblem by Dr. James Papez, Professor of Anatomy at Cornell University,(4)who concludes his report:Is emotion a magic product, or is it a\nphysiologic process which depends on an anatomic mechanism? . . . The\nevidence presented is . . . suggestive of such a mechanism as a unit\nwithin the larger architectural mosaic of the brain.Research data have been presented which deal with the anatomical\ndefects of the brain of individuals suffering from the typical mental\nand physical patterns of the so-called Mongolian idiot. In these cases\nthe gyrus cinguli of the brain were found to be absent, which indicates\nthe impossibility that these individuals function normally either\nphysically or mentally.Modern civilization has provided a large group of the defectives\nknown as Mongolian idiots. They have very definite characteristics both\nphysical and mental. Among the former, one of the most universal\nexpressions is a vacant stare associated with a face that is markedly\nunderdeveloped in the middle third, usually accompanied by narrow\nnostrils and a narrow upper dental arch.One of the outstanding characteristics of the group is their\ninability to develop mentally beyond three to eight years of age.\nBecause of the difficulty of building a character and intelligence\nlevel beyond infancy, these unfortunates are housed largely in state\ninstitutions for feebleminded. Since the physical picture is similar to\nthat which occurs in a much less severe form in a large number of\nindividuals in our modern civilization, it is important that we study\nthis group in the light of the information that is available with\nregard to their physical, mental and moral characteristics, and in the\nlight of such information as is available regarding their origin.The surveys that have been made reveal the fact that nearly all\nof them are born to mothers more than forty years of age, and\napparently at a period of very low efficiency in reproductive capacity.\nWhile most of the discussion and literature stress the importance of\nthe age of the mother, some data are now available which throw\nresponsibility also on the paternal side.Korosi, as reported by Tredgold in Mental Deficiency, came to\nthe conclusion as a result of the investigation of 24,000 unselected\nindividuals that the children of fathers below twenty or above forty\nyears of age are weaker than the children of fathers between these\nages. Also, the children of mothers over forty years of age are weaker\nthan those born to mothers below this age. Tredgold presents data\nconnecting defective structures in the brain with certain phases of\nphysical behavior and mental deficiencies. He quotes many authors whose\ndata correspond with his own. Much of this material relates to accounts\nof incomplete prenatal development of nerve structures in the\nbrain.We are particularly interested in the origin and the nature of\nthe brain lesions. Penrose,(5)in analyzing the\nrelative etiologic importance of birth order and maternal age in\nMongolism presents data obtained from an examination of 224 defectives\nin which the total number of children in all the families involved was\n1,013. Accordingly, in these families approximately 20 per cent were so\naffected. The average number of children per family was five and\none-half. He states:Mongolian imbeciles are very often born last in\na long family. This fact, which was pointed out many years ago by\nShuttleworth, has led clinicians to believe that Mongolism is to some\nextent a product of the exhaustion of maternal reproductive powers due\nto frequent child bearing. . . . The conclusion is widely accepted with\nthe reservation that the affected child is not necessarily born at the\nend of the family. Several cases are first-born, in fact, and it is\nsometimes stated that the conditions occur more frequently in first and\nlast children than in other ordinal positions. There is, however, ample\nevidence that Mongolian imbeciles have a significantly later birth rank\nthan normal children.G. Ordahl(6)has reported on a study of\nninety-one cases in which he found that fifty-six or 60 per cent were\nthe last born. The families averaged five children. He states that\n\"uterine exhaustion is the most commonly advanced reason for\nMongolism.\" Madge T. Macklin(7)says, \"It is\nusually stated that it (Mongolism) occurs more frequently in the later\npregnancies owing either to reproductive exhaustion or to too advanced\nage of the mother.\" We are concerned at this point for evidence that\nwill throw light on the relationship between the functioning of the\npituitary body in the base of the brain and the development of this\ntype of facial and mental deformity.A striking case is that of a boy sixteen years of age who was a\ntypical Mongolian idiot. He had two sisters who were much older than\nhe. His mother was a partial invalid when he was born late in her life.\nWe have no data relative to the details of the children who may have\nbeen lost. His father was living and well except for a railroad injury.\nThis boy at the age of sixteen was infantile in many of his\ncharacteristics and developments. The genitals were those of a boy\neight years old. The facial expression was that of the typical\nMongolian idiot. By the Binet test he had a mentality of about four\nyears. Roentgenograms of his hands showed that the epiphyseal bones had\nnot united. He played on the floor with blocks and with rattles like a\nchild. His interest was in children's activities. (Fig. 125.) The\noutstanding physical characteristic was his maxillary arch which was so\nmuch smaller than the mandibular arch that it went entirely inside it.\nIn order to give him a masticating surface, and with the hope of\nhelping him both physically and mentally, since several cases had\ngreatly benefited by such an operation, I determined to widen his arch\nby moving the maxillary bones apart about one-half inch. The position\nof his teeth before the moving of the bones is shown in Fig. 126.\nRoentgenograms showing the opening of the median suture with increase\nof pressure are also shown in Fig. 126. An important phase of this case\nwas that the left nostril was entirely occluded, and probably had been\nall his life. A rhinologist spent half an hour trying to shrink the\ntissue with adrenalin and cocain sufficiently to get air or water\nthrough, and was not able to do so. The quantity of air that he was\nable to inhale through his right nostril was so scant that he\ncontinually breathed with his mouth open. At night he was forced to lie\nwith something like his coat rolled into a hard ridge and placed under\nthe back of his neck and his head pushed far back to a position that\nwould open his mouth and retain it so, or he would awaken, strangling\nbecause of the closing of his mouth.FIG. 125. These views show\nphysical changes in the mongoloid type due to movement of maxillary\nbones to stimulate the pituitary gland in base of brain. Left, front\nand side view before, center, front and side view in thirty days.\nRight, front and side view six months after. Aged sixteen, infantile\nbefore, adolescent after operation. While he improved mentally he was\nharmless before and a sex pervert after operation and had to be placed\nin an institution.FIG. 126. These x-ray pictures\nshow the position of the teeth before operation to move maxillary\nbones; and progessively, by the dates shown, the widening of the upper\narch. In twelve weeks' time the boy passed through adolescence. New\nbone rapidly filled in the space between the separated bones. The space\nwas retained with a fixed bridge carrying two additional teeth. His\nmother was nearly fifty when he was born.With the movement of the maxillary bones laterally, as shown\nprogressively in Fig. 126, there was a very great change in his\nphysical development and mentality. He grew three inches in about four\nmonths. His moustache started to grow immediately; and in twelve weeks'\ntime the genitals developed from those of a child to those of a man,\nand with it a sense of modesty. His mental change was even more marked.\nThe space between the maxillary bones was widened about one-half inch\nin about thirty days. This lateral pressure on the maxillary bones was\naccomplished by rigid attachments to the teeth of the two sides of the\nupper arch. The outward movement of the maxillary bones (which form the\nroof of the mouth and sides of the nose) by pressure on the temporal\nbones produced a tension downward on the floor of the anterior part of\nthe brain, thus stimulating the pituitary gland in the base of the\nbrain. In a few weeks' time he passed through stages that usually take\nseveral years. At first, he got behind the door to frighten us; later,\nhe put bent pins on chairs to see us jump when we sat down, and finally\nhe became the cause of a policeman's coming to the office from where he\nwas conducting traffic on the corner below to find who it was squirting\nwater on him when his back was turned. He developed a great fondness\nfor calling people over the telephone, wanted to borrow my automobile\nto take his mother for a drive, and with his arm caressingly about the\nshoulders of one of the secretaries, invited her to go with him to a\ndance. All this change developed in about twelve weeks.A most remarkable event happened in connection with this\nprocedure. He lived in another city, and so, while with me, stayed in a\nboarding house at a little distance from my office in order that he\nmight have frequent, and almost constant attention. On his return to\nhis home town, his efficiency had increased to such an extent that his\nmother could send him with the money to the grocery store with the\norder for the day's groceries, and he could bring back the right change\nand could tell when it was correct. He could also come alone to me\nninety miles by railroad and make two changes of trains and the various\ntransfers on the street cars of the city with accuracy and safety.He wore an appliance in his mouth to keep the bones in position.\nThis appliance became dislodged; the maxillary bones settled together;\nimmediately, or in a day or two, he lapsed into his old condition of\nlethargy accompanied by an old trouble, which had frequently been\ndistressing, namely, nausea, this sometimes lasting for twenty-four\nhours. With the readaptation of the separating appliance and the\nreconstruction of the retaining appliance, he returned rapidly to his\nimproved condition.But a new problem had developed. We had changed an infant to a\npotential man with the impulses of a man, but with the mind of a child.\nWith the change in his physical condition he became a menace in his\ncommunity as a sex pervert. His mother died and his sister married. It\nbecame necessary to have him placed in a state institution for\ndefectives. During the period he was in my care, he had learned to read\nchild stories and newspaper headings, and had spent much time doing so.\nThe changes in his physical appearance are shown in Fig. 125, above,\nfront view, and below, side view. The first picture at the left shows\nhis appearance before the operation; the second, thirty days after; and\nthe last, six months later. The opening produced in the upper arch in\nfront of half an inch was filled by supplying two teeth on a\nrestoration, which at the same time held the maxillary bones in their\nnew position. In six months he had developed whiskers and moustache.\nThe progressive changes in the position of the maxillary bones with the\nopening of the median suture are shown in Fig. 126, together with the\nmechanical appliance. In the last view, the restoration carrying the\nporcelain teeth to fill the space is shown.A very important contribution to our knowledge of the cause of\nMongolism has recently been published by Dr. Clemens E. Benda,(8)Clinical Director of the Wrentham State School,\nWrentham, Massachusetts, in association with the Harvard Medical School\nof Boston. He and his group have approached the problem of Mongolism\nfrom two different angles; first, as to determine whether it is\naccidental, and second, whether it is a unit of symptoms which can be\nrelated to more essential alteration. Their studies including careful\nanatomical studies have been made on the basis of an examination of 125\nMongoloids. He states:Summarizing our investigations, the pituitary in\nmongoloids reveals a peculiar and definite pathology. On the basis of\nfourteen cases we feel justified in emphasizing that in mongolism\ndefinite failure of the pituitary development is to be found. Mongolism\nappears as a hypopituitarism of a specific type, in which the absence\nor deficiency of basophiles seems to be essential.The evidence indicates that this severe type of facial and brain\ninjury is related directly to a lowered reproductive capacity of the\nmother associated with age, since the majority are born to mothers\nbeyond forty years of age, and to an inadequate nutrition of the\nmother, particularly in vitamin E since this vitamin plays so important\na role in the nutrition of the pituitary body.Important new data have been provided in an analysis of births\nin the United States in connection with the development of the\nMongolian group. Bleyer(9)has reported a study\nof 2,822 cases. He reports that of the total births in the United\nStates in 1934, of 1,095,939, there were 1,822 reported as Mongoloids.\nThe average age of the mothers of these individuals was forty-one\nyears. He reports data indicating that in the age group of mothers\nforty to forty-four the chances of the development of a Mongoloid would\nbe seventy-five times as high as normal expectancy, and in the age\nforty-five to forty-nine the chances are 125 times normal expectancy.\nIn a group of 1,942 Mongoloids, 1,100 or 57 per cent were last\nchildren. These data are in keeping with those of several other\ninvestigators, and emphasize the problem of depleted reproductive\ncapacity.The interesting problems involved in the birth of identical\ntwins throw light on the origin of both physical and mental characters.\nIt is a matter of great significance in connection with these studies\nthat anomalies which we can associate with parental deficient nutrition\nare reproduced in both twins. Important additional light has been\nthrown on this phase by a family of six pairs of fraternal twins born\nto the same parents. These are reported by Dr. William W. Greulich, of\nNew Haven.(10)It is significant that nine of\nthese individuals (one of the oldest pair is deceased, and the youngest\ntwins are yet babes in arms) show marked narrowing of the nostrils and\nlack of development of the middle third of the face, narrowing of the\nface and tendency to be mouth breathers. Further, the severity of this\ncondition appears to be progressively more severe in the younger pairs\nof twins, sufficiently grown to show facial development. There is\naccordingly, evidence here of progressive lowering of reproductive\nefficiency, and the fact that both individuals are involved similarly\nhas great significance, since they are fraternal twins arising from a\nsingle ovum. This seems clearly to relate this disturbance with a\ndeficient germ plasm. Factors that are reproduced in identical twins\nwould include both hereditary characters and those that are produced by\na disturbance in environment resulting in an interference with normal\nhereditary processes. In a case of twins that are not identical, there\nis significance in the development of similar deformities which are\nlikely to be of acquired origin rather than of hereditary origin. In\nFig. 127 is seen a pair of twins. Note that they have similar\ndisturbance in the development of the dental arches with the upper\nlaterals depressed and the cuspids crowded outward in the arch.FIG. 127. These boys are twins,\nnot identical. Note, however, both have same type of deformity of the\ndental arch, apparently due to the same cause.A very important source of information which deals with the\nrelation of disturbances of the physical development of the head and\nmentality is provided by a study of the members of the teen-age group\nwho are classed as mentally backward. In an examination of a Cleveland\nschool in a colored district that has been set aside largely for boys\nand girls who are distinctly deficient in their ability to learn, it\nwas disclosed that a very large percentage suffered from gross facial\ndeformities when judged by these standards. Typical individuals in this\ngroup are shown in Fig. 128, one is white, lower left. It is clear that\nthese boys were all physically injured in the formative period. Their\nclinical history indicates that the brain was involved in this\ndisturbed development.FIG. 128. These four boys are\ntypical of a group of several hundred in a special school for backward\nchildren. Practically all showed some evidence of incomplete facial and\ndental arch development. The range of defects is wide. Blacks are\nsimilarly injured as whites. This is inhibited\nheredity.One of the problems involved in the development of the group of\ndisturbances having physical and mental expressions, is associated with\nthe sensitiveness of the body during the period of adolescence. Many\nstudents of degenerative problems have emphasized various phases of\nthis large problem. Burt\" commented: \"It is almost as though crime were\nsome contagious disease, to which the constitutionally susceptible were\nsuddenly exposed at puberty, or to which puberty left them peculiarly\nprone.\" The age of adolescence is also the period of greatest\nsusceptibility to dental caries. Data derived from chemical studies of\nthe blood and saliva show that in this period of susceptibility to\ndental caries the supplies of minerals and vitamins are inadequate to\nmeet Nature's demands, and the system borrows minerals from the\nskeleton to maintain vital processes. Lichtenstein and Brown(12)report data which reveal that educational\nquotients, like intelligence quotients, fall with increase in age\nduring the years of developing puberty. They show that the educational\nquotient at nine years of age for the group studied was 100; at eleven\nyears of age, 89; at twelve years, 83; and at thirteen years, 74. The\nchanges in facial and dental arch form, which I have described at\nlength in this volume, develop in this age period also, not as a result\nof faulty nutrition of the individual but as the result of distortions\nin the architectural design in the very early part of the formative\nperiod. Apparently, they are directly related to qualities in the germ\nplasm of one or both parents, which result from nutritional defects in\nthe parent before the conception took place, or deficient nutrition of\nthe mother in the early part of the formative period. Case records show\nthat the first signs of delinquency generally make their appearance\nduring these years. The age reported most frequently was that of\nthirteen.One expression of the rate of the progressive degeneration that\nis taking place in the United States is the increase in delinquency and\ncrime in young people between twelve and twenty years of age, as well\nas in crime in general. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Bureau of\nInvestigation, has recently published data showing comparative figures\nfor 1936 and 1937, during which time crimes in the United States\nincreased from 1,333,526 to 1,415,816, an increase of six per cent.\nThis increase is occurring in spite of the rapid development of social\norganizations for improving the environment.Preventive measures among the unsocial group, who pass through\nthe stages of predelinquency and crime, have been almost entirely\nconfined to improvement in the social surroundings of the growing\nyouth. While, no doubt, individuals with a low factor of safety are\nless likely to develop serious criminal tendencies under favorable\nenvironments, such factors as constitute a first-conditioning force,\ni.e., injury of the germ plasm, and deficient nutrition in the\ndevelopmental period are not corrected by these efforts. These new data\nrelating to the nature of the underlying causes strongly emphasize the\nneed for beginning much earlier. Indeed, the preparation for the next\ngeneration should begin early in the life of the preceding\ngeneration.Many investigators have emphasized the sensitiveness of the\nnervous system to disturbances in the formative period. Considerable\ndata have been presented indicating that the tissues of the nervous\nsystem are the most easily affected of all the structures of the body.\nThe extent of the injuries to the nervous system vary through a wide\nrange.Harris in his chapter on \"Congenital Abnormalities of the\nSkeleton\" in Blacker's(13)\"Chances of Morbid\nInheritance\" has presented data indicating the sensitive period at\nwhich the ovum is most likely to be injured:Few normal human embryos have been subjected to\ncareful study. The vast majority of human embryos examined have been\nabnormal, and it is their abnormality which has led to their abortion\nbetween the sixth and thirteenth weeks of embryonic life, a critical\nperiod associated with the development of the placenta, during which\nthe death rate is probably in the neighborhood of at least 15 per\ncent.In tracing the development of the human embryo, he tells why the\ngrowth process is very different from that of the development of\nembryos of lower forms. He states regarding deformed ova: \"Ova that\nsurvive the eighth week tend to live on to term, and are born as\nmonsters.\" I have referred previously to a personal communication from\nProfessor Shute, of the University of Western Ontario, which states\nthat he had been impressed with the high percentage of deformities in\naborted fetuses. This seems to be Nature's method of eliminating\ndefective individuals. Harris says further:It is sometimes suggested that threatened\nabortions in early pregnancy should not be treated by rest and quiet,\nas it is quite possible that the uterus is attempting to rid itself of\na pathological ovum which might become a monster in the\nfuture.The available data emphasize strongly that a very small\npercentage of the total gross deformities ever develop to menace\nsociety. Harris quotes Mall:(14)He estimated from the records of 100,000\npregnancies that there were 80,572 normal births, 11,765 abortions of\nnormal embryos and early monsters, and 615 monsters born at term. Thus\nat term 1 child in 132 is born with some anatomical defect. For each\nsuch case appearing at term, 12 others died and were aborted during\npregnancy.These data deal with gross defects involving physical\ndeficiencies in the infant and indicate that the defects that are\nproduced in the formative period, which are less severe than the above,\nare not recognizable at birth and may not be until long afterwards.\nAccording to Harris, \"During the fourth week of embryonic life the\nhead, brain and spinal cord are most susceptible to adverse\nconditions.\" He traces the sensitive areas of the various structures\nthrough the various weeks in the embryonic history. The deformities of\nthe face among the primitive races which I have illustrated extensively\nfrequently are not revealed until the eruption of the permanent\ndentition and the development of the adult features. While it is true\nthat many children show deformity in facial development even in\nbabyhood and childhood, those individuals are usually much more\nseriously injured when the adult face is developed.Bloom(15)has presented the anatomical\nand histological characteristics of a defective born to a mother\nfifty-one years of age, whose general health was reported as good. The\ninfant's facial pattern was markedly divergent from normal and\npractically no brain tissues had been formed. This expression of an\nextreme injury was entirely beyond that with which we are concerned in\nthe study of the mental and the moral cripples who constitute an\nincreasing part of our society. This is presented to emphasize Nature's\ninexorable requirement that each parent shall be individually\nphysically fit for the responsibility of producing the next generation.\nSeveral primitive races studied have realized this responsibility.There are some phases of modern physical degeneration in which\nmost of us take part with remarkable complacency. We would consider it\na great misfortune and disgrace to burn up the furniture in our homes\nto provide warmth, if fuel were available for the collection. This is\nprecisely what we are doing with our skeletons by a process of\nborrowing, simply because we fail to provide new body repairing\nmaterial each day in the food. You are all familiar with the tragic\nmisfortune that overtakes so many elderly people through the accident\nof a broken hip or other fractured bone. Statistics show that\napproximately 50 per cent of fractured hips occurring in people beyond\n65 years of age never unite. We look upon this as one of the inevitable\nconsequences of advancing age. In Chapter 15 I have referred to the\nsmall boy whose leg was broken when he fell in a convulsion while\nwalking across the kitchen floor. That bone did not break because the\nblow was hard but because the minerals had been borrowed from the\ninside by the blood stream in order to maintain an adequate amount of\nthe minerals, chiefly calcium and phosphorus in the blood and body\nfluids. He had been borrowing from his skeleton for months because due\nto a lack of vitamins he could not absorb even the minerals that were\npresent in the inadequate food that he was eating. The calcium and the\nphosphorus of the milk were in the skimmed milk that he was using but\nhe needed the activators of the butter-fat in order to use the\nminerals. Simply replacing white bread with these activators and the\nnormal minerals and vitamins of wheat immediately checked the\nconvulsions.We have many other expressions of this borrowing process. Much\nof what we have thought of as so-called pyorrhea in which the bone is\nprogressively lost from around the teeth thus allowing them to loosen,\nconstitutes one of the most common phases of the borrowing process.\nThis tissue with its lowered defense rapidly becomes infected and we\nthink of the process largely in terms of that infection. A part of the\nlocal process includes the deposit of so-called calculus and tartar\nabout the teeth. These contain toxic substances which greatly irritate\nthe flesh starting an inflammatory reaction. Many primitive peoples not\nonly retain all of their teeth, many of them to an old age, but also\nhave a healthy flesh supporting these teeth. This has occurred in spite\nof the fact that the primitives have not had dentists to remove the\ndeposits and no means for doing so for themselves. Note particularly\nthe teeth of the Eskimos. The teeth are often worn nearly to the gum\nline and yet the gum tissue has not receded. Many of these primitive\ngroups were practically free from the affection which we have included\nin the general term of pyorrhea or gingivitis. Pyorrhea in the light of\nour newer knowledge is largely a nutritional problem. While nutrition\nalone often will not be adequate for correcting it, when established\npractically no treatment will be completely adequate without\nreinforcing the nutrition in so far as deficient nutrition has been a\ncontributing factor. Nutrition plus the frequent removal of deposits,\nplus suitable medication will check and prevent pyorrhea but not\ncorrect the damage that has already been done. The elements that are\nchiefly needed in our nutrition are those that I have outlined as being\nparticularly abundant in the menus as used by several of the primitive\nraces. These are discussed in detail in Chapter 15.Another important aspect of this problem of borrowing has to do\nwith the progressive shrinking of the skeleton as evidenced by the\nshortening of the stature. I have measured many individuals who have\nlost from two to six inches in height in a decade or two. I have seen a\nfew individuals who have lost as much as ten inches of their height by\nthis process of borrowing from the skeleton. Our bodies need a certain\namount of fresh minerals every day with which to manufacture blood. The\ndays that these minerals are not provided in the foods they will be\ntaken from our storage depots, the skeleton.A particularly tragic phase of this problem of borrowing from\nthe bone is seen in growing girls and is chiefly due to their ambition\nto avoid enlargement of their bodies to keep down their weight. The\ngirls deprive themselves of body building material at a time when their\nbodies are growing and are requiring considerable new mineral. Forming\nbone has a prior claim on minerals, which is sufficiently commanding to\ninduce the individual to borrow from bones that are already formed to\nprovide for the necessary lengthening and growth. By this process many\nof the bones of the body are softened, particularly the bones of the\nspine. Curvatures develop, one of the expressions of which may be round\nor stooped shoulders.Among primitive races this type of girl, so commonly seen in our\nmodern civilization, is absent. Probably not one of these girls has\never suspected the suffering and sorrow that is being stored up for\nfuture life as a result of this bad management at a critical time in\nher development. Fig. 134 illustrates one of the tragedies of this\nborrowing process. Practically all of these physical evidences of\ndegeneration can be prevented and fortunately many of them can be\nrelieved in large part with an adequate nutrition. Even ununited\nfractures often can be induced to unite by an adequate reinforcement of\nthe nutrition. This is true not only for young people but for elderly\npeople as well.In addition to the problems growing out of physical injuries\nthrough lack of development before birth, which express themselves as\nfacial and other deformities, there is increasing need for concern for\nphysical handicaps entailed in underdevelopment of the hips. The\ndifficulty encountered at childbirth in our modern civilization has\nbeen emphasized by Dr. Kathleen Vaughan(16)of\nLondon. In her book, \"Safe Childbirth,\" she states that faults of\ndevelopment more than race modify pelvic shape. In the Foreword to her\nbook, Dr. Howard A. Kelly, Professor Emeritus of Gynaecological\nSurgery, Johns Hopkins University, says:Dr. Vaughan presents such an array of facts and\ndata that the book must impress every reader. It is of vital importance\nthat her conclusions be considered, for in my opinion our methods of\nbringing up our girls and the habits of our women with many of the\ncustoms of 'civilized' life must be radically readjusted.This important work should be made available for reference in the\nschool libraries of the United States. Further data from it are\npresented in Chapter 21.The great contrast in discomfort and length of time of the labor\nof modern mothers is to be contrasted with ease of childbirth among\nprimitive mothers. Many workers among the primitive races have\nemphasized the vigorous health and excellence of the infant at birth.\nWe have here, therefore, emphasis on the need in the interest of the\ninfant that the mother shall have an easy and short labor. Both of\nthese factors are directly influenced by the vitamin content of the\nmother's body as supplied by her nutrition and also by the physical\ndevelopment of her body if her mother at the time of gestation and\nprior to conception had adequate vitamins in her food to insure perfect\ngerm cells.The sensitivity of the brain to injury resulting from medication\ngiven the mother has been emphasized by Dr. Frederic Schreiber of\nDetroit. In his paper before the American Medical Association meeting\nin San Francisco, June, 1938, he was quoted as saying(17)that the analysis showed that 72 per cent of the\nchildren had shown difficulty in breathing at the time of birth or in\nthe first few days following birth. He concluded, therefore, that this\ndifficulty in breathing was the cause of the brain damage.Difficulty in breathing would lead to a shortage of oxygen. An\ninsufficient supply of oxygen in the blood stream would have serious\neffects upon the tissues of the brain. In this connection, he cited\nevidence found in post-mortem examinations that deficiency of oxygen\ncaused microscopic changes in the brain.X-ray photographs of some of the children examined by Dr.\nSchreiber showed various degrees of brain atrophy.The contribution of Dr. Schreiber also emphasizes strongly the\nsusceptibility of the brain tissue to injuries which may handicap the\nindividual throughout life.REFERENCESLAIRD, D.

When we realize the\nquantities of many of the minerals which must enter into the\ncomposition of the bodies of human beings and other animals, we\nappreciate the difficulty of providing in pasture and agricultural\nsoils a concentration of these minerals sufficient to supply the needs\nfor plant growth and food production. If we think of growing plants and\ngrasses in terms of average soil tilled to a depth of seven inches, we\nare dealing with a total of approximately two million pounds of soil\nper acre, of which two thousand pounds will be phosphorus in its\nvarious chemical forms, some of which will not be readily available for\nplants. If one-half of this phosphorus were present in an available\nform, there would be enough for only one hundred poor crops, utilizing\nten pounds to the acre for the seed alone; or for forty good crops,\ntaking twenty-five pounds per acre, assuming that the seed were to be\nremoved from that land and not replaced. A sixty-bushel crop of wheat\nor corn per acre takes twenty-five to twenty-eight pounds of phosphorus\nin the seed. The soil is depleted of calcium similarly, though that\nmineral is not usually present in such limited amounts nor so rapidly\ntaken away as is phosphorus. The leaves and stems of rapidly growing\nyoung plants and grasses are rich in calcium and phosphorus. As the\nplants ripen the phosphorus is transported in large amounts to the seed\nwhile most of the calcium remains in the leaves. A large part of the\ncommerce of the world is concerned with the transportation of chemical\nelements as foods, chief of which are calcium and phosphorus. Whether\nthe product of the soil is ultimately used as wheat for bread, milk and\nmeat for foods, or wool and hides for clothing, every pound of these\nproducts that is shipped represents a depletion of soil for pasturage\nor for grain production.If we think of one hundred good crops constituting the limit of\ncapacity of the best soils, and one-fourth of that for a great deal of\nthe acreage of the tillable soil, we are probably over-generous. This\nproblem of depletion may seem to many people unimportant, either\nbecause there has been no consciousness that depletion has been taking\nplace, or because they believe that replenishment is a simple\nmatter.In correspondence with government officials in practically every\nstate of the United States I find that during the last fifty years\nthere has been a reduction in capacity of the soil for productivity in\nmany districts, amounting to from 25 to 50 per cent. I am informed also\nthat it would cost approximately fifty dollars per acre to replenish\nthe supply of phosphorus.Many people realize that farms they knew in their childhood have\nceased to be productive because they have \"run out.\" The movement of\npopulation to cities and towns is, in part, the result of the call of\nthe social center and in part a consequence of the need of forsaking\ndepleted soil. While there are many things that influence the movement\nfrom the farms, there is much to be learned from the government census\nreports which deal directly with farm acreage and values.If we relate the levels of life of human and domestic animals to\nthe problem of soil depletion, we find two important groups of data.\nFirst, there are those which relate to specific land areas, some small\nand some very large; and second, those which relate to civilizations\nand groups, both large and small that have passed out of existence or\nare rapidly deteriorating. A study of the skeletons of the past and\npresent often discloses a progressive breakdown. For example, we may\nmention the important anthropological findings of Professor Hooton of\nHarvard, who, in his examinations of various pueblos of the Western\nPlains, especially at the Pecos Pueblo where the progressive burials\nhave been uncovered, has brought to light the calendar of a\ncivilization extending over a thousand years. These findings show that\nthere has been over the period of years a progressive increase in\nskeletal deformities, including arthritis and dental caries, together\nwith a reduction in stature, suggesting a direct relationship to\nprogressive depletion of the soil.In a recent magazine article, I have presented data(1)comparing the mineral content of different pasture\ngrasses, and relating these to deficiencies in cattle. Unfortunately,\nspace does not permit reviewing these data here in detail. They show\nthat calcium varied from 0.17 per cent for a dry pasture grass in\nArizona to 1.9 per cent in a Pennsylvania pasturage plant, to 2 per\ncent in a British Columbia pasturage plant, a range of over ten fold.\nSimilarly, phosphorus was shown to vary from 0.03 per cent to 1.8 per\ncent, a range of sixty fold. Neither pasture animals nor human beings\ncan eat a sufficient amount of low mineral plant food to provide the\ntotal mineral requirements of ordinary metabolism. In cases of\noverload, such as pregnancy and lactation in adults, and rapid growth\nin children, the demand is increased greatly. For example, a\nhigh-milk-production cow from southern Texas on a certain low mineral\npasture will run behind her normal requirements about 60 grams of\nphosphorus and 160 grams of potassium per day. In that district large\nnumbers of cattle were unable at the time to maintain their own bodies,\nlet alone reproduce or provide milk. Many cattle in the district\ndeveloped loin disease. It was found that moving them to another plot\nof ground where the soil was not depleted provided recovery.About thirty-seven billion dollars, or approximately 40 per cent\nof the cash income of salaries and wages of the people in the United\nStates, is used for the purchase of foods. When we add to this the\nexpenditure of energy by the people living on the land, it represents a\ntotal, probably exceeding fifty billion dollars a year that is spent\nfor the chemicals that are provided in the foods, a large amount of\nwhich, perhaps 50 per cent, will have been expended for calcium and\nphosphorus, perhaps 25 per cent for other chemicals, and 25 per cent\nfor special vitamin or activator carrying foods. Of this enormous\ntransportation of minerals from the soil an exceedingly small\nproportion gets back to the tillable land in this country. Orr(2)states that \"Consumption in the United Kingdom of\nlive stock products mostly derived from grass lands has been estimated\nat about four hundred million pounds sterling per annum (nearly two\nbillion dollars) .\" This includes dairy products, meats and hides.\nNever in the history of the world has there been such a large scale\ndepletion of the soil by transportation away from the tilled and\npasturage areas. Sickness in the United States has been calculated to\ncost nearly half as much as food, and is increasing.An important discovery has been made with regard to the feeding\nof dairy cattle and other live stock: the nutritive value of young\ngrass, when in a state of rapid growth, carries not only a very large\nquantity of minerals, but also digestible proteins in amounts that are\napproximately equivalent to those provided by the concentrated cereal\ncattle foods, such as linseed cake. It is observed also that not only\ndo the milk products of such cows remain at a high level while the cows\nare on the rapidly growing young grass, particularly a rapidly growing\nyoung wheat grass or young rye grass, but the animals themselves are in\nbetter physical condition than when on grain concentrates. Further,\nthat calves fed on the milk of those cows grow much more rapidly than\nthey do when the cows are on other fodder and have a much higher\nresistance to disease. Grass, to provide these nutritional factors,\nmust be grown on a very rich, well-balanced soil. A young plant, of\nnecessity, produces a rapid depletion of soil. Minerals and other\nchemicals are removed and therefore there is need for adequate\nreplacement.In Chapter 18 I have reported investigations made by Professors\nMeigs and Converse at the Beltsville Experimental Station, in which\nthey have shown that feeding cattle on a grade of dried hay that was\nlow in chlorophyll resulted in the development of dead or blind calves,\nand further that when the milk of these cows was fed to three normal\ncalves they died in fifty-seven, sixty-two and seventy-one days\nrespectively. These calves had been fed on whole milk until twenty days\nof age. They show that the main deficiency in this ration was vitamin\nA.Since mammals require milk in infancy and since it is the most\nefficient single food known, I have made a special study of milk and\nits products. The role of the vitamins and other activating substances\nin foods is quite as important and essential as that of minerals. These\nactivating substances, in general, can be divided into two groups,\nthose that are water-soluble and those that are fat-soluble, the former\nbeing much more readily obtained in most communities, than the latter.\nSince the fat-soluble and also the water-soluble vitamins are essential\nfor mineral utilization and particularly since the fat-soluble\nactivators are so frequently found to be inadequately supplied in diet\nand are usually more difficult to obtain, a special effort has been\nmade to determine the level of these in dairy products in many\ndifferent places for different seasons of the year. To accomplish this,\nI have obtained each year since 1927 samples of cream and butter,\nmostly butter, for analysis for their activator content. The work has\nrapidly extended so that for the eleventh year we are receiving now\n(1939) samples from several hundred places distributed throughout the\nworld, usually once or twice a month throughout the year. Methods used\nfor these studies are both biologic and chemical. These data are used\nin connection with morbidity and mortality statistics for the same\ndistricts.The progressive changing of the levels of life is shown by the\nmorbidity and mortality statistics of the various areas of the United\nStates and Canada. The American Heart Association publishes, from time\nto time, very important data relative to the number of deaths from\nheart disease in the various states of the Union. It is of interest to\nnote that the highest mortality levels that are obtained are found in\nthose states, in general, that have been longest occupied by modern\ncivilizations, namely, the Atlantic States, the New England States, the\nGreat Lakes States and the Pacific States. Their data published in\ntheir booklet ~tHeart Disease Mortality Statistics\" and based on the\nUnited States Registration area reveal that the death rate per 100,000\npopulation was 123 in 1900. The data sent me in November 1937 from the\nUnited States Census Bureau, Department of Commerce, in Washington,\nreport the death rate from heart per 100,000 for 1934 as 239.9, in\nother words an increase of 86.9 per cent in thirty-four years. Figures\nprovided by the Bureau of Census for England and Wales show the death\nrate per 100,000 to be 269.3; and for Scotland, 232. While the average\nfigure for the United States Registration area of 224 deaths per\n100,000 seems very high, it is exceedingly important to note that the\nNew England States were much higher, leading the entire country.\nMassachusetts reported 307.3; New Hampshire, 323.1; Vermont, 310.8; New\nYork, 302.1; Maine, 297.5. The rate of increase in the decade of 1921\nto 1930 was 51.3 per cent for Delaware; 52 per cent for Connecticut, 51\nper cent for Pennsylvania, 59.4 per cent for Missouri, 60.0 per cent\nfor Washington; 55 per cent for Wisconsin; 64 per cent for Louisiana;\n71 per cent for Florida; 63 per cent for South Carolina; 81 per cent\nfor Montana; 61 per cent for Kentucky; and 51.9 per cent for North\nCarolina. Such rates of increase as these are cause for alarm.Sir Arnold Theiler, who spent a quarter of a decade studying the\nproblems of nutritional deficiency diseases among pasture animals in\nSouth Africa, has discussed at length the reduction of phosphorus in\navailable quantities for plant development as constituting, by far, the\nmost important mineral deficiency. He reported data obtained from many\ncountries through the world, indicating that the deterioration of\ncattle and sheep can be directly traced to an inadequate amount of\nphosphorus in the soil. He states, in discussing the relation of this\nproblem to the conditions as they obtain in Australia, that:(3)Amongst the Australian data the figures showing\ndepletion of phosphorus as a result of sale of products off the farm\nwithout adequate replacement by manuring, are interesting. Thus\nRichardson estimates that it would take two million tons of\nsuperphosphate to replace the phosphorus removed in the form of milk,\nmutton and wool. In the \"ranching stage\" of the development of a\ncountry the fact is often forgotten that the balance of Nature is\nfrequently disturbed to the detriment of generations to\ncome.It is important to keep in mind that morbidity and mortality\ndata for many diseases follow a relatively regular course from year to\nyear, with large increases in the late winter and spring and a marked\ndecrease in summer and early autumn. The rise and fall of the level of\nmorbidity with the changing season produces curves that are exceedingly\nregular for the same place from year to year. The distribution,\nhowever, is distinctly different for different latitudes and altitudes.\nIt is further of special importance to note that the curves for the\nSouthern Hemisphere, with its opposite seasons, are in reverse of those\nof the Northern Hemisphere, and have very similar levels for the same\nseasonal periods. I have obtained the figures for the levels of\nmorbidity for several diseases in several countries, including the\nUnited States and Canada. I find that the distribution of the rise and\nfall in morbidity and mortality does not follow the sunshine curve but\ndoes follow the curve of vegetable growth. Accordingly, I have made\nstudies by dividing the United States and Canada into sixteen\ndistricts, four from East to West and four from North to South. I have\nplotted by months the levels of mortality for heart disease and\npneumonia in these various districts, from figures obtained from the\ngovernments of these two countries. Similarly, I have plotted curves\nfor the vitamin content found in butter and cream samples obtained from\nthese sixteen districts. When these are arranged in accordance with the\nlevels by months they are found, in each case, to be opposite to the\nmortality from heart disease and pneumonia. It is also important to\nnote that while these curves show a higher midsummer level of vitamins\nin dairy products in the northern tier of districts, the period of high\nlevel is shorter than in the more southern division. Two peaks tend to\nappear in the summer cycle of curves for the vitamins, one representing\nthe spring period of active growth and the other, the fall period.\nThese peaks are closer together in the north than in the south.A particularly important phase of this study is the finding of a\nlower level of vitamins throughout the year in those districts which\ncorrespond with the areas of the United States and Canada that have\nbeen longest settled, and consequently most depleted by agriculture. A\nsimilar study has been made based on the data published in a report by\nTisdall, Brown and Kelley,(4)of Toronto. Their\nfigures for children's diseases which included chicken pox, measles,\nnephritis, scarlet fever, hemorrhage of newborn, tetany and\nretropharyngeal abscess were arranged according to the incidence for\neach month. All of these diseases show a relatively high incidence\nduring February and March, rising in December and January, falling\nduring April and May, reaching a very low level in midsummer and then\nmaking a rapid increase during the autumn. These are opposite to the\nvitamin levels found in the dairy products of Ontario for the same\nmonths.In Chapter 3, I discussed data obtained during two summers in\nthe Loetschental and other Swiss valleys. The Loetschental Valley has\nbeen isolated from contact with surrounding civilizations by its unique\nphysical environment. For twelve hundred years during which time a\nwritten history of the valley has been kept, the people have maintained\na high level of physical excellence providing practically all their\nfood, shelter and clothing from the products raised in the valley.\nCattle and goats provided milk, milk products and meat. The stock was\ncarefully sheltered during the inclement weather and great care was\nused to carry back to the soil all of the enrichment. This, of course,\nis a process that is efficiently carried out in many parts of the world\ntoday. In this manner extensive depletion of the minerals required for\nfood for animals and human beings may be prevented. Their practice is\nin striking contrast to that in many of the agricultural districts of\nthe United States in which the minerals are systematically shipped from\nthe land to the cities, there to be dissipated to the ocean through the\nsewerage system. Among many primitive races there is some attempt to\npreserve the fertility of the soil. For example, in Africa, many of the\ntribes that depend in part on agriculture, cleared off only a few acres\nin the heart of a forest and cropped this land for a limited number of\nyears, usually less than ten. Great care was taken to prevent the loss\nof the humus both through drenching rains and wind erosion. The\ndecaying vegetation and lighter soil that might be dislodged by the\nwater were caught in the entanglement of roots and shrubbery\nsurrounding the agricultural patch. The surrounding trees protect the\nsoil from wind erosion. Care was taken not to form gullies, furrows and\ngrooves that could carry currents of water and thus float away the\nvaluable humus from the soil. This again is in contrast to conditions\nin other parts of the world, particularly in the United States. Sears(5)has stated that \"Bare ground left by the\nplow will have as much soil washed off in ten years as the unbroken\nprairie will lose in four thousand. Even so, soil in the prairie will\nbe forming as fast as, or faster than it is lost.\" In Nature's program,\nminerals are loaned temporarily to the plants and animals and their\nreturn to the soil is essential. To quote again from Sears.What is lent by earth has been used by countless\ngenerations of plants and animals now dead and will be required by\ncountless others in the future. In the case of an element such as\nphosphorus, so limited is the supply that if it were not constantly\nbeing returned to the soil, a single century would be sufficient to\nproduce a disastrous reduction in the amount of life.The history of preceding civilizations and cultures of mankind\nindicate the imbalances that have developed when minerals have been\npermanently transferred from the soil. There are only a few localities\nin the world where great civilizations have continued to exist through\nlong periods and these have very distinct characteristics. It required\nonly a few centuries, and in some profligated systems a few decades to\nproduce so serious a mineral depletion of the soil that progressive\nplant and animal deterioration resulted. In such instances, regular and\nadequate replenishment was not taking place.The replenishment may be made, as in the case of the prairie\nwith its plant and animal life, through a replacement in the soil of\nborrowed minerals, a program carried out efficiently by a few\nintelligent civilizations. The balance of the cultures have largely\nfailed at this point. Another procedure for the replenishing of the\ndepleted soils is by the annual spring overflow of great water systems\nwhich float enrichment from the highlands of the watersheds to the\nlower plains of the great waterways. This is illustrated by the history\nof the Nile which has carried its generous blanket of fertilizing humus\nand rich soil from the high interior of Africa northward over its long\ncourse through Sudan and Egypt to the Mediterranean, and thus made it\npossible for the borders of the Nile to sustain a population of greater\ndensity than that of either China or India. The salvation of Egypt has\nbeen the fact that the source of the Nile has been beyond the reach of\nmodernizing influences that could destroy Nature's vast stores of these\nreplenishing soil products. Where human beings have deforested vast\nmountainsides at the sources of the great waterways, this whole problem\nhas been changed.A similar situation has occurred in China. Her two great rivers,\nthe Yangtze and the Yellow River, having their sources in the isolated\nvastness of the Himalayas in Tibet, have through the centuries provided\nthe replenishment needed for supporting the vast population of the\nplains of these great waterways. Together with this natural\nreplenishment the Chinese have been exceedingly efficient in returning\nto the soil the minerals borrowed by the plant and animal life. Their\nefficiency as agriculturists has exceeded that of the residents of most\nparts of the populated world.The story in Europe and America has been vastly different in\nmany districts. The beds of roots of trees and grasses that hold the\nmoisture and induce precipitation have been rudely broken up. An\nimportant function of the plant and tree roots is the entanglement of\ndead plant life. Vegetation holds back moisture at the time of melting\nsnows and rainy seasons so efficiently that disastrous floods are\nprevented and a continuing flow of water maintained over an extended\nperiod. Under the pressure of population more and more of the highlands\nhave been denuded for agriculture; the forests have often been\nruthlessly burned down, frequently with the destruction of very\nvaluable timber. The ashes from these great conflagrations provided\nfertilizer for a few good crops, but these chemicals were dissipated\nrapidly in the swift flow of the water in which they were soluble, with\nthe result that vast areas that Nature had taken millenniums to forest\nhave been denuded and the soil washed away in a few decades. These\nmountainsides have become a great menace instead of a great storehouse\nof plant food material for the plains country of the streams. Loss of\ntimber which was needed greatly for commerce and manufacture has been\nanother disastrous result. The heavy rains of the spring now find\nlittle impediment and rush madly toward the lower levels to carry with\nthem not the rich vegetable matter of the previous era, but clay and\nrocks which in a mighty rush spread over the vast plains of the\nlowlands. This material is not good soil with which to replenish and\nfertilize the river bottoms. On the contrary, it often covers the\nplains country with a layer of silt many feet deep making it impossible\nto utilize the fertile soil underneath.We have only to look over the departed civilizations of historic\ntimes to see the wreckage and devastation caused by these processes.\nThe rise and fall in succession of such cultures as those of Greece,\nRome, North Africa, Spain, and many districts of Europe, have followed\nthe pattern which we are carving so rapidly with the rise and fall of\nthe modernized culture in the United States.The complacency with which the masses of the people as well as\nthe politicians view our trend is not unlike the drifting of a merry\nparty in the rapids above a great cataract. There seems to be no\nappropriate sense of impending doom.An outstanding example of our profligate handling of soil and\nwatersheds may be seen in our recent experiences in the Mississippi\nBasin. The Ohio River draining the western slopes of the Allegheny\nMountains has gone on rampages almost annually for a decade carrying\nwith it great damage to property and loss of life. Other branches of\nthe Mississippi, particularly the Missouri, draining the eastern slopes\nof the Rocky Mountains have gone out of control so that vast areas are\nflooded with silt. There is now a concerted effort to stem this series\nof cataclysms by building dykes along the great waterways to raise the\nbanks and dams in the higher regions of the watershed to hold back the\nfloods. These artificial lakes become settling pools for the silt and\nsoon lose their efficiency by being filled with the debris that they\nare holding back from the lower levels. An effort is also being made to\nreforest which is purposeful, but when we consider the millenniums of\ntime that Nature has required to build the tanglewood of plant life,\nshrubbery and trees over the rocks and through the gullies to act as\ngreat defenses for holding back the water, these modern programs offer\nvery little assurance for early relief.Another very destructive force is the wind. When surfaces are\ndenuded either at high or low altitudes the wind starts carving up the\nsoil and starts it on the march across the country. We call the\ndemonstrations dust storms. When we travel through our Western States,\nit is not uncommon to see buildings and trees partially buried in these\nrolling dunes of drifting sand. When we were traveling across the\ndesert of Peru in 1937, we saw in many places mountain-like dunes\nrolling slowly across the country, frequently so completely blocking\nformer traffic routes that long detours were necessary. When we were\nflying over eastern Australia in search of groups of primitive\naborigines, we saw great forests gradually being engulfed with these\nmarching billows of sand so that most of the trees were covered to\ntheir tips.Few people will realize that it is estimated that only about 45\nper cent of the land surface of the United States is now available for\nagricultural purposes and grazing. This includes vast areas that are\nrapidly approaching the limit of utility.In one of my trips to the Western States I visited a large ranch\nof some fifty thousand acres. I asked the rancher whether he was\nconscious of a depletion in the soil of the ranch in its ability to\ncarry pasture cattle. He said that it was very greatly depleted, that\nwhereas formerly the cows on the ranch were able to produce from\nninety-three to ninety-five healthy calves per hundred cows annually,\nnearly all of sufficiently high physical quality to be available for\nreproductive purposes, now he was getting only forty to forty-four\ncalves per hundred cows annually and usually only ten or eleven of\nthese were physically fit for reproductive purposes. He stated also\nthat he was able to raise as many calves for restocking the ranch on\nthe plant food produced on the fifty acres to which he was applying a\nhigh fertilization program as on the rest of the fifty-thousand-acre\nranch. Of late most of the calves for the ranch had to be imported from\nother states.In a city in the vicinity I inquired of the director of public\nhealth what the death rate was among their children up to one year of\nage. He stated that the figures were progressively increasing in spite\nof the fact that they were giving free hospitalization and free\nprenatal and postnatal care for all mothers who could not afford to pay\nfor the service. This death rate had more than doubled in fifty years.\nI asked how he interpreted the increasing mortality rate among the\ninfants and mothers. His comment was in effect that they could not\nexplain the cause, but that they knew that the mothers of this last\ngeneration were far less fit physically for reproduction than their\nmothers or grandmothers had been.To many uninformed people the answer will seem simple. Those who\nare responsible for these programs, recognize the difficulty in\nreplenishing the exhausted minerals and food elements in adequate\nquantity. I have been informed by the director of the department of\nagriculture of the state of Ohio that it would cost fifty dollars per\nacre to restore the phosphorus alone that has been exhausted during the\nlast fifty to one hundred years. He stated that the problem is still\nfurther complicated by the fact that the farmer cannot go to a bank and\nborrow money to buy this fertilizer. If, however, he buys adjoining\nacreage to double his own, he can then borrow twice as much money as he\ncan on his own farm. But this is not all of the difficulty. Recent data\nindicate that if sufficient phosphorus in a form easily available for\nplant use were supplied to the land at once, it would kill the plant\nlife; it must be provided in a form in which by a process of weathering\nit is made slowly available for plant utilization. Phosphorus is only\none of the minerals that is readily taken from the soil. Other minerals\nalso are difficult to provide. I have been able practically to double\nthe weight and size of beets in five weeks by the addition of a\ntablespoonful of ferric ammonium citrate to each square foot of garden\nsoil.An important commentary on soil depletion is provided by the\nlarge number of farms that have been abandoned in many districts\nthroughout the United States. The severe industrial depression which\nhas thrown large numbers of shop and mill workers out of employment,\nhas induced a considerable number of these to return to the land for\nsubsistence. As one drives through farming districts that once were\nvery fertile many farms are seen apparently abandoned insofar as\ntillage is concerned.In my studies on the relation of the physiognomy of the people\nof various districts to the soil, I have found a difference in the\nfacial type of the last generation of young adults when compared with\nthat of their parents. The new generation has inherited depleted soil.\nIn many communities three generations of adults are available for\nstudy. The yardstick for these comparisons has been developed in the\npreceding chapters. It will be of interest for the readers to apply\nthis yardstick to their own brothers and sisters in comparison with the\nparents and particularly their grandparents. The most serious problem\nconfronting the coming generations is this nearly unsurmountable\nhandicap of depletion of the quality of the foods because of the\ndepletion of the minerals of the soil.REFERENCESPRICE, W.

One of the most urgent changes in our viewpoint should be to\nlook upon the assortment of physical, mental and moral distortions as\ndue, in considerable part, to nutritional disturbances in one or both\nparents which modify the development of the child, rather than to\naccepted factors in the inheritance. The evidence indicates that these\nparental disturbances of nutritional origin may affect the germ plasm,\nthus modifying the architecture, or may prevent the mother from\nbuilding a complete fetal structure, including the brain. In other\nwords, these data indicate that instead of dealing entirely with\nhereditary factors, we are dealing in part with distortions due to\ninhibitions of normal hereditary processes. This changes the prospects\nfor the offspring of succeeding generations. Atavism will still have\nplenty to her credit even if she must give up her claim to distortions\nof individual characteristics.Jacobson(1)has summarized the\ndetermining factors in individuality and personality when he says \"The\nJekyll-Hydes of our common life are ethnic hybrids.\" Most current\ninterpretations are fatalistic and leave practically no escape from our\nsuccession of modern physical, mental and moral cripples. Jacobson says\nof our modern young people:Very much of the strange behavior of our young\npeople to-day is simply due to their lack of ethnical anchorage; they\nare bewildered hybrids, unable to believe sincerely in anything, and\ndisowned by their own ancestral manes. To turn these neurotic hybrids\nloose in the world by the million, with no background, no heritage, no\ncode, is as bad as imposing illegitimacy; their behavior, instead of\nexpressing easily, naturally and spontaneously a long-used credo, will\nbe determined by fears and senseless taboos. How can character be built\nupon such foundations? There is a ludicrous as well as a pathetic side\nto the situation presented by a Greek puzzled by his predominantly\nGerman children, or by the German woman unable to understand her\npredominantly Spanish progeny. It is a foolish case over again of hen\nhatching ducklings, of wolf fostering foundlings.If our modern degeneration were largely the result of\nincompatible racial stocks as indicated by these premises, the outlook\nwould be gloomy in the extreme. Those who find themselves depressed by\nthis current interpretation of controlling forces would do well to\nrecall the experiments on pigs referred to in Chapters 17 and 18, in\nwhich a large colony all born blind and maimed because of maternal\nnutritional deficiency--from deficient vitamin A--were able to beget\noffspring with normal eyes and normal bodies when they themselves had\nnormal nutrition.Much emphasis has been placed on the incompatibility of certain\nracial bloods. According to Jacobson,(1)Aside from the effects of environment, it may\nsafely be assumed that when two strains of blood will not mix well a\nkind of \"molecular insult\" occurs which the biologists may some day be\nable to detect beforehand, just as blood is now tested and matched for\ntransfusion.It is fortunate that there is a new explanation for the\ndistressing old doctrine which holds that geniuses cannot be born\nunless there is an abundant crop of defectives. In this connection\nJacobson says,The genius tends to be a product of mixed ethnic\nand nervously peculiar stock--stock so peculiar that it exhibits an\nunusual amount of badness. The human family pays dearly for its\ngeniuses. Just as nature in general is prodigal in wasting individuals\nfor the development of a type, or species, so do we here find much\nhuman wastage apparently for a similar purpose. One may think of the\ninsane and the defectives as so many individuals wasted in order that a\nfew geniuses may be developed. It would seem' that in order to produce\none genius there must be battalions of criminals, weaklings and\nlunatics. Nietzsche must have had biologic implications of this sort in\nmind when he spoke of the masses as merely \"fertilizers\" for the\ngenius. This is why the genius has been compared to the lily on the\ndunghill. He absorbs all the energy of his family group, leaving the\nfertilizing mass depleted.Our recent data on the primitive races indicate that this theory\nis not true, since in a single generation various types and degrees of\nphysical, mental or moral crippling may occur in spite of their purity\nof blood and all that inheritance could accomplish as a reinforcement\nthrough the ages.The extent to which the general public has taken for granted\nthat there is a direct relationship between mental excellence and\nmental deficiency is illustrated by the commonly heard expression\n\"great wits and fools are near akin\" which expresses tersely the\nattitude of a modern school of psychiatry. This doctrine is not\nsupported by controlled data from scientifically organized\ninvestigations. One of the principal exponents quoted is Maudsley who\nstated \"it is not exaggeration to say that there is hardly ever a man\nof genius who has not insanity or nervous disorder of some form in his\nfamily.\" Many reviews of the lives of great men have been published in\nsupport of this doctrine. Havelock Ellis, however, one of the leading\npsychologists and psychiatrists of our day, has shown that the\npercentage of cases substantiating this doctrine is less than 2 per\ncent and less than half that proportion found in the population at\nlarge, which in a tested group he found to be 4.2 per cent. East of\nHarvard in discussing this problem states, after reviewing the evidence\npro and con: \"Thus it is seen that where one collates the work of the\nmost competent investigators on the possibility of relation between\ninsanity and genius the conclusion is unavoidable that none\nexists.\"Those who still believe in the old fatalistic doctrines may\nanswer the questions why the last child is affected seriously much more\noften than would be expected through chance; or why the most severe\ndefectives are born after mothers have exceeded forty years of age; and\nstill further why our defectives are found chiefly among the later\nmembers of large families. These facts are not explainable by Mendel's\nlaws of heredity.Professor J. C. Brash, of the University of Birmingham, in his\nmonograph(2)discusses the current theories in\ndetail. He emphasizes the role of heredity as the controlling factor in\nthe origin of divergencies. However, all of the distortions of the face\nand jaws which he presents as being related to heredity can be\nduplicated, as I have shown, in the disturbances appearing in the first\nand second generation after primitive racial stocks have adopted the\nfoods of our modern civilizations in displacement of their native\nfoods. He emphasizes the importance of an adequate diet during the\ngrowth period of the child, and also the fact that malocclusion is not\na direct manifestation of rickets. Hellman has emphasized the\nimportance of childhood diseases. The disturbances which we are\nstudying here, however, are not related to these influences.Two of the outstanding advances in laboratory and clinical\napproach to this problem of the relation of the structure of the brain\nto its function as expressed in mentality and behavior have been the\nwork of Tredgold in England, referred to in Chapter 19, and the\n\"Waverly Researches in the Pathology of the Feeble-Minded,\" in\nMassachusetts. Tredgold recognizes two sources of brain injury,\n\"germinal blight\" and ''arrest'' and puts particular stress on the\nformer as being pathological and not spontaneous, and related to the\ngerm of either or both parents due to poisoning of the germ cell. The\n\"arrest\" problems have to do with intra-uterine environmental\ndisturbances.The Waverly group have made very detailed anatomical studies,\nboth gross and microscopic, of brains of mental defectives and related\nthese data to the clinical characteristics of the individuals both\nmental and physical when living. They have reported in detail two\ngroups of studies of ten individuals each. In their summary of the\nsecond group they state:(3)The provisional conclusions drawn from the second\nseries and the combined first and second series are much in agreement\nwith the original conclusions drawn from the first series which were as\nfollows: First that measurable brain can be correlated with testable\nmind in the low and high orders with fairly positive results. That is\nthe small simple brains represented the low intellects or idiots and\nthe most complex brain patterns corresponded to the high grade, moronic\nand subnormal types of feeble-mindedness.The lessons from the primitive races demonstrate certain\nprocedures that should be adopted for checking the progressive\ndegeneration of our modernized cultures. If, as now seems indicated,\nmal-development with its production of physical, mental and moral\ncripples is the result of forces that could have been reduced or\nprevented, by what program shall we proceed to accomplish this\nreduction or prevention?I have presumed in this discussion that the primitive races are\nable to provide us with valuable information. In the first place, the\nprimitive peoples have carried out programs that will produce\nphysically excellent babies. This they have achieved by a system of\ncarefully planned nutritional programs for mothers-to-be. It is\nimportant to note that they begin this process of special feeding long\nbefore conception takes place, not leaving it, as is so generally done\nuntil after the mother-to-be knows she is pregnant. In some instances\nspecial foods are given the fathers-to-be, as well as the\nmothers-to-be. Those groups of primitive racial stocks who live by the\nsea and have access to animal life from the sea, have depended largely\nupon certain types of animal life and animal products. Specifically,\nthe Eskimos, the people of the South Sea Islands, the residents of the\nislands north of Australia, the Gaelics in the Outer Hebrides, and the\ncoastal Peruvian Indians have depended upon these products for their\nreinforcement. Fish eggs have been used as part of this program in all\nof these groups. The cattle tribes of Africa, the Swiss in isolated\nhigh Alpine valleys, and the tribes living in the higher altitudes of\nAsia, including northern India, have depended upon a very high quality\nof dairy products. Among the primitive Masai in certain districts of\nAfrica, the girls were required to wait for marriage until the time of\nthe year when the cows were on the rapidly growing young grass and to\nuse the milk from these cows for a certain number of months before they\ncould be married. In several agricultural tribes in Africa the girls\nwere fed on special foods for six months before marriage. The need for\nthis type of program is abundantly borne out by recent experimental\nwork on animals, such as I have reported in Chapters 17, 18 and 19.Another important feature of the control of excellence of child\nlife among the primitive races has been the systematic spacing of\nchildren by control of pregnancies. The interval between children\nranged from two and a half to four years. For most of the tribes in\nAfrica this was accomplished by the plural-wife system. The wife with\nthe youngest child was protected.The original Maori culture of New Zealand accomplished the same\nend by birth control and definite planning. In one of the Fiji Island\ntribes the minimum spacing was four years.These practices are in strong contrast with either the\nhaphazard, entirely unorganized programs of individuals in much of our\nmodern civilization, or the organized over-crowding of pregnancies also\ncurrent. The question arises immediately: what can be done in the light\nof the data that I have presented in this volume to improve the\ncondition of our modern civilization? A first requisite and perhaps by\nfar the most important is that of providing information indicating why\nour present haphazard or over-crowded programs of pregnancies are\nentirely inadequate. This should include, particularly, the education\nof the highschool-age groups, both girls and boys.In the matter of instruction of boys and girls it is of interest\nthat several of the primitive races have very definite programs. In\nsome, childbirth clinics supervised by the midwife are held for the\ngrowing girls. With several of these tribes, however, the ease with\nwhich childbirth is accomplished is so great that it is looked upon as\nquite an insignificant experience. Among the ancient Peruvians,\nparticularly the Chimu culture, definite programs were carried out for\nteaching the various procedures in industry, home-building and home\nmanagement. This was accomplished by reproducing in pottery form, as on\npractical water jugs, the various incidents to be demonstrated. The\nmatter of childbirth was reproduced in detail in pottery form so that\nit was common knowledge for all young people from earliest observation\nto the time the practical problems arose. Many of the problems related\ndirectly were similarly illustrated in pottery forms.It is not sufficient that information shall be available through\nmaternal health clinics to young married couples. If pigs need several\nmonths of special feeding in order that the mothers-to-be may be\nprepared for adequate carrying forward of all of the inheritance\nfactors in a high state of perfection, surely human mothers-to-be\ndeserve as much consideration. It is shown that it is not adequate that\nsufficient vitamin A be present to give the appearance of good health.\nIf highly efficient reproduction is to be accomplished there must be a\ngreater quantity than this. There is no good reason why we, with our\nmodern system of transportation, cannot provide an adequate quantity of\nthe special foods for preparing women for pregnancy quite as\nefficiently as the primitive races who often had to go long distances\nwithout other transportation than human carriers.The primitive care of a newborn infant has been a matter of\nsevere criticism by modernists especially those who have gone among\nthem to enlighten them in modern ways of child rearing. It is common\npractice among many primitive tribes to wrap the newborn infant in an\nabsorbent moss, which is changed daily. A newborn infant, however, does\nnot begin having regular all over baths for a few weeks after birth.\nWhile this method is orthodox among the primitives it is greatly\ndeplored as a grossly cruel and ignoble treatment by most moderns. Dr.\nWilliam Forest Patrick of Portland, Oregon was deeply concerned over\nthe regularly occurring rash that develops on newborn infants shortly\nafter they are first washed and groomed. He had a suspicion that Nature\nhad a way of taking care of this. In 1931 he left the original oily\nvarnish on several babies for two weeks without the ordinary washing\nand greasing. He found them completely free from the skin irritation\nand infection which accompanies modern treatment. This method was\nadopted by the Multanomah County Hospital of Oregon which now reports\nthat in 1,916 cases of unwashed, unanointed babies only two cases of\npyodermia occurred. They record that each day the clothing was changed\nand buttocks washed with warm water. Beyond this the infants were not\nhandled. Dr. Patrick states that within twelve hours after birth by\nNature's method the infant's skin is clear, and Nature's protective\nfilm has entirely disappeared. In my observations of the infant's care\namong primitive races I have been continually impressed with the great\ninfrequency with which we ever hear a primitive child cry or express\nany discomfort from the treatment it receives. Of course, when hungry\nthey make their wants known. The primitive mother is usually very\nprompt, if possible, to feed her child.Among the important applications that can be made of the wisdom\nof the primitive races is one related to methods for the prevention of\nthose physical defects which occur in the formative period and which\nresult in physical, mental and moral crippling. When I visited the\nnative Fijian Museum at Suva, I found the director well-informed with\nregard to the practices of the natives in the matter of producing\nhealthy normal children. He provided me with a shell of a species of\nspider crab which the natives use for feeding the mothers so that the\nchildren will be physically excellent and bright mentally, clearly\nindicating that they were conscious that the mother's food influenced\nboth the physical and mental capacity of the child. The care with which\nexpectant mothers were treated was unique in many of the Pacific\nIslands. For example, in one group we were informed that the mother\ntold the chief immediately when she became pregnant. The chief called a\nfeast in celebration and in honor of the new member that would come to\njoin their colony. At this feast the members of the colony pledged\nthemselves to adopt the child if its own parents should die. At this\nfeast the chief appointed one or two young men to be responsible for\ngoing to the sea from day to day to secure the special sea foods that\nexpectant mothers need to nourish the child. Recent studies on the\nvitamin content of crabs have shown that they are among the richest\nsources available. We have then for modern mothers the message from\nthese primitives to use the sea foods liberally, both during the\npreparatory period in anticipation of pregnancy and during that entire\nperiod. In Fig. 129 will be seen a woman of one of the Fiji Islands who\nhad gone several miles to the sea to get this particular type of\nlobster-crab which she believed, and which her tribal custom had\ndemonstrated, was particularly efficient for producing a highly perfect\ninfant.FIG. 129. This Fiji woman has\ncome a long distance to gather special foods needed for the production\nof a healthy child. These and many primitive people have understood the\nnecessity for special foods before marriage, during gestation, during\nthe nursing period and for rebuilding before the next\npregnancy.For the Indians of the far North this reinforcement was\naccomplished by supplying special feedings of organs of animals. Among\nthe Indians in the moose country near the Arctic circle a larger\npercentage of the children were born in June than in any other month.\nThis was accomplished, I was told, by both parents eating liberally of\nthe thyroid glands of the male moose as they came down from the high\nmountain areas for the mating season, at which time the large\nprotuberances carrying the thyroids under the throat were greatly\nenlarged.Among the Eskimos I found fish eggs were eaten by the\nchildbearing women, and the milt of the male salmon by the fathers for\nthe purpose of reinforcing reproductive efficiency.The coastal Indians in Peru ate the so-called angelote egg, an\norgan of the male fish of an ovoviviparous species. These organs were\nused by the fathers-to-be and the fish eggs by the mothers-to-be.In Africa I found many tribes gathering certain plants from\nswamps and marshes and streams, particularly the water hyacinth. These\nplants were dried and burned for their ashes which were put into the\nfoods of mothers and growing children. A species of water hyacinth is\nshown in Fig. 130. The woman shown in Fig. 130, with an enormous\ngoiter, had come down from a nine-thousand-foot level in the mountains\nabove Lake Edward. Here all the drinking water was snow water which did\nnot carry iodine. She had come down from the high area to the\nsixthousand-foot level to gather the water hyacinth and other plants to\nobtain the ashes from these and other iodine carrying plants to carry\nback to her children to prevent, as she explained, the formation of\n\"big neck,\" such as she had. The people living at the six-thousand-foot\nlevel also use the ashes of these plants.FIG. 130. This African woman\nwith goiter has come down from the 9000 foot level in the mountains in\nBelgian Congo near the source of the Nile to a 6000 foot level to\ngather special plants for burning to carry the ashes up to her family\nto prevent goiter in her children. Right, a Nile plant, a water\nhyacinth burned for its ashes.Among many of the tribes in Africa there were not only special\nnutritional programs for the women before pregnancy, but also during\nthe gestation period, and again during the nursing period.As an illustration of the remarkable wisdom of these primitive\ntribes, I found them using for the nursing period two cereals with\nunusual properties. One, was a red millet which was not only high in\ncarotin but had a calcium content of five to ten times that of most\nother cereals. They used also for nursing mothers in several tribes in\nAfrica, a cereal called by them linga-linga. This proved to be the same\ncereal under the name of quinua that the Indians of Peru use liberally,\nparticularly the nursing mothers. The botanical name is quinoa. This\ncereal has the remarkable property of being not only rich in minerals,\nbut a powerful stimulant to the flow of milk. I have found no record of\nthe use of similar cereals among either the English or American\npeoples. In Chapter 14, I presented data indicating that the Peruvians,\nwho were descendants of the old Chimu culture on the coast of Peru,\nused fish eggs liberally during the developmental period of girls in\norder that they might perfect their physical preparation for the later\nresponsibility of motherhood. These fish eggs were an important part of\nthe nutrition of the women during their reproductive period. They were\navailable both at the coast market of Peru and as dried fish eggs in\nthe highland markets, whence they were obtained by the women in the\nhigh Sierras to reinforce their fertility and efficiency for\nchildbearing. A chemical analysis of the dried fish eggs that I brought\nto my laboratory from Alaska as well as of samples brought from other\nplaces has revealed them to be a very rich source of body-building\nminerals and vitamins. Here again, I have found no record of their use\nin our modern civilization for reinforcing physical development and\nmaternal efficiency for reproduction. As I have noted in Chapter 15\nspecial nutrition was provided for the fathers by tribes in the Amazon\njungle, as well as by the coastal tribes.Professor Drummond, a British bio-chemist, in discussing the\nquestion of the modern decline in fertility, before the Royal Society\nof Medicine(4)suggested that the decline in\nthe birth rate in European countries, during the last fifty years, was\ndue, largely, to the change in national diets which resulted from the\nremoval of vitamins B and E from grains when the embryo or germ was\nremoved in the milling process. He called attention to the fact that\nthe decline in the birth rate corresponded directly with the time when\nthe change was made in the milling process so that refined flour was\nmade available instead of the entire grain product.Of the many problems on which the experience of the primitive\nraces can throw light, probably none is more pressing than practical\nprocedures for improving child life. Since this has been shown to be\nlargely dependent upon the architectural design, as determined by the\nhealth of the parental germ cells and by the prenatal environment of\nthe child, the program that is to be successful must begin early enough\nto obviate these various disturbing forces. The normal determining\nfactors that are of hereditary origin may be interrupted in a given\ngeneration but need not become fixed characteristics in the future\ngenerations. This question of parental nutrition, accordingly,\nconstitutes a fundamental determining factor in the health and physical\nperfection of the offspring.One of the frequent problems brought to my attention has to do\nwith the responsibility of young men and women in the matter of the\ndanger of transmitting their personal deformities to their offspring.\nMany, indeed, with great reluctance and sense of personal loss decline\nmarriage because of this fear, a fear growing out of the current\nteaching that their children will be marked as they have been.On the presumption that all mentally crippled individuals will\nbe in danger of transmitting these qualities to their offspring there\nis a strong movement continually in operation toward segregating such\nindividuals or incapacitating them by sterilization. Several primitive\nracial stocks have produced large populations without criminals and\ndefectives by means of an adequate nutritional program which provided\nnormal development and function. May it not be that even our\ndefectives, when they have resulted from poisoning of germ cells or\ninterference with an adequate normal intrauterine environment, may be\nable to build a society with a high incidence of perfection, that will\nprogressively return toward Nature's ideal of human beings with normal\nphysical, mental and moral qualities? Because of its interpretation of\nthe individual's responsibility for his mental and moral qualities,\nsociety has not only undertaken to protect itself from the acts of\nso-called unsocial individuals but has proceeded to treat them as\nthough they were responsible for the injury that society has done to\nthem. Does it not seem inevitable that this apparently false attitude\nwill change if it be demonstrated that they are the result of a program\nof inadequate nutrition for the parents.As we have seen, the children born in many of the families of\nprimitive racial stocks after the parents have adopted our modernized\ndietary, may have marked changes in the facial and dental arch forms.\nIn our modernized white civilization this change occurs so frequently\nthat in a considerable percentage of the families there is seen a\nprogressive narrowing of the dental arches in the succeeding children\nof the same family. Since the position of the permanent teeth which\nerupt at from seven to twelve years of age, can be determined by x-rays\nearly in child life, this procedure provides an opportunity to\nanticipate deformities that will make their appearance with the\neruption of the permanent teeth.In Fig. 131, may be seen the x-rays of the upper arches of three\nchildren. Even under conditions causing the permanent teeth to develop\nirregularly the deciduous dental arch will not show the deformity that\nwill be expressed later in the permanent dental arch. The abnormal\nplacement of the developing permanent teeth, however, will show the\ndeformity that is later to be produced in the face even though the\ndeciduous arch is normal in design. Both deciduous and permanent teeth\ncan be seen at the same time. In Fig. 131 it will be seen that there is\na progressive deformity revealed in the position of the permanent teeth\nin these three children. (Most severe in the youngest.) This narrowing\nof the curve made by the permanent teeth is a condition characteristic\nof a large number of individuals, occurring in at least 25 per cent of\nthe families throughout the United States; in some districts the\npercentage will reach 50 to 75 per cent.FIG. 131. X-rays of teeth of\nthree children in one family show in the teeth and upper arch a\nprogressive injury in the younger children as indicated by the\nprogressive narrowing of the placement of the tooth buds of the upper\npermanent teeth. Note the narrowing curve of the arch.Another striking illustration of this progressive injury in the\nyounger members of the family, detected early by the x-rays, is shown\nin Fig. 132. Note the breadth of the arch of the permanent teeth of the\noldest child (to the left), and the marked narrowing of the arch of the\ntwo younger children (to the right).FIG. 132. These x-rays\nillustrate the progressive injury in the two younger children in this\nfamily. Note the progressive narrowing of the permanent arch\nillustrated by the lapping of the laterals over the centrals in the\nyoungest, and decreasing distance between the cuspids.While the application of orthodontic procedures for the improve-\nment of the facial form and arrangement of the teeth will make a vast\nimprovement in facial expression, that procedure will not modify\ndisturbances in other parts of the body, such as the abnormal\nunderdevelopment of the hips and pelvic bones. If an improvement in\nnutrition for the mothers-to-be is adequately provided in accordance\nwith the procedures of the primitives, it should be possible to prevent\nthis progressive lowering of the capacity of our modern women to\nproduce physically fit children.Fig. 133 is another illustration. The oldest child, ten years of\nage, is shown at the upper left. She has a marked underdevelopment of\nthe width of the face and dental arches. The nostrils are abnormally\nnarrow and she tends to be a mouth breather. She is very nervous and is\nbecoming stooped. In the lower left photograph, is shown an x-ray of\nthe narrowed upper arch. At the right is shown her younger sister, six\nyears of age. It will be seen that the proportions of her face are much\nmore normal and that she breathes with complete ease through her nose.\nShe has none of the nervous trouble of her older sister. In the x-rays,\nbelow, at the right, it will be seen that her permanent arch, as\nindicated by the positions of the permanent teeth, although not so far\nadvanced as that of her sister, has good design. The history of these\npregnancies is of interest. The duration of labor for the first child\nwas fifty-three hours and for the second three hours. Following the\nbirth of the first child the mother was a partial invalid for several\nmonths. Following that of the second child the experience of childbirth\nmade but slight impression on the strength and health of the mother.\nDuring the first pregnancy no special effort was made to reinforce the\nnutrition of the mother. During the second pregnancy the selection of\nfoods was made on the basis of nutrition of the successful primitives.\nThis included the use of milk, green vegetables, sea foods, organs of\nanimals and the reinforcement of the fat-soluble vitamins by very high\nvitamin butter and high vitamin natural cod liver oil. It is a usual\nexperience that the difficulties of labor are greatly decreased and the\nstrength and vitality of the child enhanced where the mother has\nadequately reinforced nutrition along these lines during the formative\nperiod of the child.FIG. 133. In this family the\nfirst child to the left was most injured in the formative period as\nshown in the form of the face and dental arches above and x-rays below.\nThe first child required fifty-three hours of labor and the second\nthree hours, preceded by special nutrition of the\nmother.The problem of maternal responsibility with regard to the\nphysical capacity of their offspring to reproduce a healthy new\ngeneration comprises one of the most serious problems confronting\nmodern degenerating society. In a previous chapter I have discussed the\ndifficulty that zoological garden directors have had in rearing members\nof the cat family in captivity. It has been a very general experience\nuntil the modern system of feeding animal organs was instituted, that\nunless the mothers-to-be had themselves been born in the jungle the\nlack of development of the pelvic arch would frequently prevent normal\nbirth of their young. In the Cleveland Zoo a very valuable tigress,\nthat had been born in captivity, found it impossible to give birth to\nher young. Although a Caesarian operation was performed, she lost her\nlife. The young also died. One of the veterinaries told me that the\npelvic arch was entirely too small to allow the young to pass through\nthe birth canal. Studies of the facial bones of this animal showed\nmarked abnormality in development.The result of disturbance in the growth of the bones of the head\nand of the development of general body design is quite regularly a\nnarrowing of the entire body, and often there is a definite\nlengthening. Statistics have been published relative to the increase in\nthe height of girls in colleges during the last few decades. This is\nprobably a bad rather than a good sign as actually it is an expression\nof this change in the shape of the body. I am informed by gynecologists\nthat narrowing of the pelvic arch is one of the factors that is\ncontributing to the increased difficulties that are encountered in\nchildbirth by our modern generation.A typical case illustrating the relationship between the lack of\npelvic development and deformity of the face, is presented in Fig. 134.\nThis girl presented a very marked underdevelopment of the lower third\nof the face which produced the appcarance of protrusion of her upper\nteeth so that it was quite difficult or impossible for her to cover\nthem with her lips. An operation to improve her appearance consisted in\nremoving the first bicuspid on each side above and then moving the bone\ncarrying the anterior teeth backward with appliances, the width of the\ntwo removed teeth. This changed the relationship of the teeth as shown\nin the two upper views in Fig. 134. The operation greatly improved her\nfacial appearance and she lost the inferiority complex which had\nprevented her from mingling with young people. When she went to the\nhospital for her first child, there was special concern because of her\nweak heart, and every effort was made to obtain a normal birth rather\nthan one by Caesarian section. This proved impossible and the Caesarian\noperation was done. Great difficulty was experienced in saving the life\nof the mother and child. Her boyish figure, of which she had been so\nproud, and which had been a part of her serious deformity, during her\nformative period had nearly resulted in her undoing. She nursed her\nbaby for some time but the overdraft of reproduction on her frail body\nwas so great that she aged rapidly, her back weakened and she stooped\nforward as shown in Fig. 134, lower right. In the view at the lower\nleft, it will be seen that the teeth remained in their new position. A\npoint to keep in mind is that her physical deficiency was probably\ndirectly caused by an inadequate nutrition of her mother during the\nintrauterine development and prior to conception. It is, of course,\npossible that the father also contributed a poisoned germ cell that\nconstituted a disturbance in the architectural design of the offspring.\nIn this connection, it is important to have in mind the tragic\ninfluence of a program of deliberate starvation of mothers-to-be in\norder that the bones of the baby may be soft and thus provide an easy\nbirth. Some literature has been published indicating the foods that\nwould be efficient in accomplishing this. This means almost certain\nwreckage or handicapping of the child's life.FIG. 134. This girl suffered\nwith a serious deformity of her face. She also had very contracted\npelvic arch. The facial deformity was improved as shown. She nearly\nlost her life with the birth of her first baby which was removed by\nCaesarian operation. Note her badly deformed back from the overload of\nreproduction.Information from many sources may suggest that the expectant\nmother needs more calcium and more vitamin D. She may go to the\npharmacy with a prescription or on her own initiative obtain calcium\ntablets and so-called vitamin D as a synthetic preparation. We are\nconcerned here with data which will throw light on the comparative\nvalue of the treatment the modern mother will thus give herself with\nthat that the primitive mother would provide.Dr. Wayne Brehm who is associated with two Columbus, Ohio,\nhospitals has recently published the results(5)of a study of the effect of the treatment received in 540 obstetrical\ncases divided into six groups of ninety individuals each, on the basis\non which their nutrition was reinforced in order to study the\ncomparative effects of the different treatments. The reinforcement of\nthe diet consisted in Group 1 of taking calcium and synthetic vitamin D\nas viosterol; Group 2, calcium alone; Group 3, viosterol alone; Group\n4, calcium and cod liver oil; Group 5, cod liver oil alone and Group 6,\nno reinforcement. For those receiving the calcium and viosterol there\nwas extensive calcification in the placentae, marked closure of the\nfontanelle (the normal opening in the top of the infant skull) and\nmarked calcification in the kidneys. For those receiving calcium alone\nthere was no placental calcification, slight closure of the fontanelle\nand no calcification of the kidneys. Group 3 receiving viosterol had\nmoderate to marked placental calcification, moderate closure of the\nfontanelle and no calcification of the kidneys. Those receiving cod\nliver oil alone had very slight placental calcification, slight\nfontanelle closure and no calcification in the kidneys. Those receiving\nno reinforcement had very slight placental calcification, normal\nfontanelle closures and no calcification of the kidneys. The effect on\nthe mother was a prolonging of labor in Group 1 and at birth the fetal\nheads were less moulded not being able to adjust their shape to the\nshape of the birth tube. These infants had a general appearance of\nossification or postmaturity. This strongly emphasizes the great\ndesirability of using Nature's natural foods instead of modern\nsynthetic substitutes.It is a matter of great importance that the most serious\ndisturbances in reproduction and childbirth are occurring in the most\ncivilized parts of the world. In Chapter 19 I have referred to the\nimportant work of Dr. Kathleen Vaughan entitled \"Safe Childbirth.\" She\nhas not only had wide experience among several tribes in India and in\nthe British Hospitals but has collected a large quantity of information\nregarding the experience of many races throughout the world. Her data\nstrongly emphasize the necessity that the growing girl shall be allowed\nto have an active outdoor life not only until the completion of the\nbuilding of her body at about fourteen years of age, but through the\nchild-bearing period. In practically all countries a restricted\nsedentary indoor life greatly increases the complications associated\nwith childbirth. She quotes Whitridge Williams to the effect that: \"At\nthe onset of pregnancy the (males) are 125 to 100 (females), and he\nadds that sex is determined in the germ cells, primarily or immediately\nafter their union, and is immutable by the time segmentation of the\novum begins.\" Notwithstanding this advantage, prenatal and infant\nmortality reduces the proportion of boys to a level below that of\ngirls. Dr. Vaughan in her reference to the data on the annual report of\nthe chief medical officer, the Minister of Health, states as\nfollows:Our infant mortality returns show that over half\nthe number of infants dying before they are a year old die before they\nhave lived a month (and 6,744 of them before they are twenty-four hours\nold), strongly suggesting that their vitality was impaired by the\nprocess of birth. The figures of those who did not survive one month\nare 20,060, and of thesemore than half are males. So we lose over\nten thousand boys every year under a month old!(Public Health\nReport, No. 55, British). Hear what Dr. Peter McKinley has to say on\nthe subject. \"The death rate of infants in the period immediately\nsubsequent to birth is nine times as high as that which occurs later in\nthe first years of life.\" He shows how the difficulty experienced by\nthe mothers during parturition leads to the death of infants at and\njust after birth, and says in this connection, \"Infant deaths under a\nmonth are significantly associated with the death rates of mothers in\nchildbearing.\" He quotes Netherland statistics showing that of\nstillbirths due to difficulty during birth, male stillbirths\npredominate, and says, \"These figures might be taken in support of the\nview that the greater size of the male head is a cause of some greater\ndifficulty in labour than there is with a female birth.\" Here, indeed,\nin civilized childbirth is the laboratory where the sex of the\npopulation is finally determined-the actual births of boys and girls\nare nearly equal in number, but the small ones slip through; the larger\nchildren are the ones who are killed during birth, or so damaged that\nlife is heavily handicapped, and we are left with an enormous surplus\nfemale population. This destruction of male infants, which goes on day\nby day and year by year, puts the consequences of the Great War into\nthe shade. Our surplus female population (now reaching over one and a\nhalf million in excess of the male) is directly due to it. We have no\nneed of Pharaoh's midwives to kill our boys off at birth (Exodus i.\n16). Civilization does it unaided, for all civilized races as they pass\ntheir zenith and are on the downgrade have eventually had to face the\nsame problem, the outnumbering of men by women, and most of them have\nmet it as the East does to-day by female infanticide. A more\nintelligent policy would be to prevent the males dying at birth. We see\nthat difficult childbirth leads to a high maternal mortality, but it is\nalso the cause of a high infant mortality falling most heavily upon the\nmale infants, and it is also responsible for the production of mental\ndefectives in ever-increasing numbers.Dr. Vaughan's work places emphasis on the necessity that the\nhuman body be properly built, especially that of the mother-to-be. She\nshows clearly that the shape of the pelvis is determined by the method\nof life and the nutrition. In all primitive tribes living an outdoor\nlife childbirth is easy and labor is of short duration. She shows that\nthis is associated with a round pelvis and that the distortion of the\npelvis to a flattened or kidney shape, even to a small degree, greatly\nreduces the capacity and therefore the ease with which the infant head\nmay pass through the birth canal. In Dr. Vaughan's wide experience she\nhas observed two ways by which a rough estimate of the pelvic shape and\ncapacity may be anticipated: first, by the gait of the individual,\nbecause the angle of the hips is determined by the shape of the pelvis;\nand second, by the teeth and jaws. She has recognized an association\nbetween facial and dental arch deformities and deformed pelvis.During my investigations in eastern Australia I was informed\nthat the birth rate among the whites had declined over a large area and\nto such an extent that many families had no children and many women\ncould produce only one child. The diets used in that district were very\nlargely refined white-flour products, sugar, polished rice, vegetable\nfats, canned goods and a limited amount of meat. The alarm regarding\nthe declining birth rate in Australia has recently been a matter of\ndiscussion by the New South Wales legislature as indicated by an\nAssociated Press dispatch from Sydney, Australia, dated August 1, 1938:\n\"A 'stork derby' with sweepstakes prizes was proposed in the New South\nWales Legislature today to boost Australia's falling birth rate.\"A report just received from the Bureau of Home Economics,\nDepartment of Agriculture, Washington, presents figures for the average\namount of the various foods used in different income groups in\ndifferent parts of the United States. These showed that in general\nabout one-third of the income up to $2500 was spent for food per\nfamily; further, that the total flour equivalent ranged from 0.39 to\n0.50 pound per capita per day. These quantities will furnish about 829\nto 1063 calories per day, per capita. It will be seen at once that this\nprovides a large number of the calories required for growing children\nand sedentary adults per day. With this number of calories derived from\nrefined flour products there is no adequate provision for a normal\namount of such body-building materials as minerals and vitamins. These\nhave been removed, largely, in the milling process, and are largely\ndenied to our modern civilization insofar as the cereal foods are\nconcerned. This includes vitamin E, so essential for the functioning of\nthe pituitary gland, the master governor of the body.One of the most important lessons we may learn from the\nprimitive cultures is the detail of their procedures for preventing\ndental caries. Since I have devoted an entire chapter (Chapter 16) to\nthis I will make only a brief comment here. Simply stated, the\npractical application of the primitive wisdom for accomplishing this\nwould involve returning to the use of natural foods which provide the\nentire assortment of bodybuilding and repairing food factors. This\nmeans the recognition of the fact that all forms of animal life are the\nproduct of the food environments that have produced them. Therefore, we\ncannot distort and rob the foods without serious injury. Nature has put\nthese foods up in packages containing the combinations of minerals and\nother factors that are essential for nourishing the various organs.\nSome of the simpler animal forms are able to synthesize in their bodies\nsome of the food elements which we humans also require, but cannot\ncreate ourselves. Our modern process of robbing the natural foods for\nconvenience or gain completely thwarts Nature's inviolable program. I\nhave shown how the robbing of the wheat in the making of white flour\nreduced the minerals and other chemicals in the grains, so as to make\nthem sources of energy without normal body-building and repairing\nqualities. Our appetites have been distorted so that hunger appeals\nonly for energy with no conscious need for body-building and repairing\nchemicals.A first requisite for the control of tooth decay is to have\nprovided an adequate intake of the body-building and repairing factors\nby the time the hunger appeal for energy has been satisfied. A\nsufficient variety of foods must be used to supply the body's demand\nfor those elements which it needs in large quantities, that is, calcium\nand phosphorus, and the other elements which it needs in smaller\nquantities, though just as imperatively. One of the serious human\ndeficiencies is the inability to synthesize certain of the activators\nwhich include the known vitamins. This makes necessary the\nreinforcement of the nutrition with definite amounts of special foods\nto supply these organic catalysts, especially the fat-soluble\nactivators, including the known vitamins, which are particularly\ndifficult to provide in adequate quantities. I have shown that the\nprimitive races studied were dependent upon one of three sources for\nsome of these fat-soluble factors, namely, sea foods, organs of animals\nor dairy products. These are all of animal origin. I have indicated in\nChapter 16 the nutritional programs that have proved in clinical\ntesting adequate for providing the body with nutrition that will not\nonly prevent tooth decay, but check it when it is active. The stress\nperiods of life, namely, active growth in children and motherhood, do\nnot constitute overloads among most of the primitive races because the\nfactor of safety provided by them in the selection of foods is\nsufficiently high to protect them against all stresses. I have\nindicated the type of nutrition that is especially needed for these\nstress periods in our modern civilization. Also, that it is not\nnecessary to adopt the foods of any particular racial stock, but only\nto make our nutrition adequate in all its nutritive factors to the\nprimitive nutritions. Tooth decay is not only unnecessary, but an\nindication of our divergence from Nature's fundamental laws of life and\nhealth. (See Chapter 16 for primitive menus.) The responsibility of our\nmodern processed foods of commerce as contributing factors in the cause\nof tooth decay is strikingly demonstrated by the rapid development of\ntooth decay among the growing children on the Pacific Islands during\nthe time trader ships made calls for dried copra when its price was\nhigh for several months. This was paid for in 90 per cent white flour\nand refined sugar and not over 10 per cent in cloth and clothing. When\nthe price of copra reduced from $400 a ton to $4 a ton, the trader\nships stopped calling and tooth decay stopped when the people went back\nto their native diet. I saw many such individuals with teeth with open\ncavities in which the tooth decay had ceased to be active.In undertaking to make practical application of primitive wisdom\nto our modern problems, the field is so broad that only a limited\nnumber of items may be included. It is important to emphasize the\ndifference between the procedures used in the preparation of boys and\ngirls for life in many of the primitive groups, and in our modern\nsocial organization. Few people will realize the remarkable training\ngiven the primitive children, with the fathers and mothers as tutors.\nTo illustrate, among the Indians of the far North in Canada near the\nArctic Circle, the girls rather than the boys select a companion for\nlife. This is done with the help of her parents. Before a boy is\nconsidered worthy of consideration he must demonstrate that he can\nbuild the winter cabin, provide the firewood for maintaining the home\nof the parents, and all of the provisions of wild game, during the\ntrial period of several weeks. After an adequate demonstration of\nbravery as well as of skill, in which the boy must kill a grizzly bear,\nhe is accepted into the home for a period of trial marriage. The girl\nhas the privilege of making her choice by trial, but when the choice is\nmade there is complete faithfulness on the part of both. Girls are\nprepared for life's duties by being taught to make clothing, prepare\nfood, care for children and assist in the maintenance of the home. I\nhave seldom, if ever, seen such happy people as these forest Indians of\nthe far North.In Chapter 10, in discussing the Australian Aborigines, I have\nsimilarly described the preparation of boys for the responsibility of\nmanhood. No modern college graduate has to win his spurs under more\nexacting examinations and tests than do those boys.In Africa several specialties call for special training. The\nmedicine men spend several years under the training of a tutor. Each\nboy must provide a specified number of cattle per year which are eaten\nby the group.Probably the most indelible impression that is left by my\ninvestigations among primitive races, is that which came from examining\n1,276 skulls of the people who had been buried hundreds of years ago\nalong the Pacific Coast of Peru and in the high Andean Plateau, without\nfinding a single skull with the typical marked narrowing of the face\nand dental arches, that afflicts a considerable proportion not only of\nthe residents in modernized districts in Peru, but in most of the\nUnited States and many communities of Europe today. I know of no\nproblem so important to our modern civilization as the finding of the\nreason for this, and the elimination of the cause of error. Perhaps few\nwill recognize the significance of this important point. This may be\nthe reason why the prospect is not encouraging.One of the important lessons we should learn from the primitive\nraces is that of the need for maintaining a balance beween soil\nproductivity, plant growth and human babies. Even in a country with so\nlow a fertility as obtains in the greater part of Australia, the\nAborigines for a very long period were able to maintain this balance.\nTheir system of birth control was very efficient and exacting.A survey made by a committee appointed by the League of Nations\nindicates the need per capita of approximately one-half acre of land\nfor wheat, two acres for dairy products, and ten acres for beef\nproducing pasture for the supply of meat. When we realize that Ohio has\nbeen occupied by our modern civilization for only one hundred fifty\nyears and that it is estimated that during that time approximately half\nof the topsoil has been lost through water and wind erosion we realize\nthat Nature's accumulated vegetable enrichment has been greatly reduced\nin this area within a short time from this one source alone. In Chapter\n20 I have shown that there is only enough phosphorus in the top seven\ninches of agricultural land for approximately fifty crops of high-yield\nwheat or one hundred crops of moderate-yield. Other grains make similar\ndrafts upon the land. I have given data indicating a relationship\nbetween progressive soil depletion and progressive increase in heart\ndisease.It is apparent that the present and past one or two generations\nhave taken more than their share of the minerals that were available in\nthe soil in most of the United States, and have done so without\nreturning them. Thus, they have handicapped, to a serious extent, the\nsucceeding generations, since it is so difficult to replenish the\nminerals, and since it is practically impossible to accumulate another\nlayer of topsoil, in less than a period of many hundreds of years. This\nconstitutes, accordingly, one of the serious dilemmas, since human\nbeings are dependent upon soil for their animal and plant foods, for\nbody-building. The minerals are in turn dependent upon the nutritive\nfactors in the soil for establishing their quality. The vitamin and\nprotein content of plants has been shown to be directly related to\navailability of soil minerals and other nutriments. A program that does\nnot include maintaining this balance between population and soil\nproductivity must inevitably lead to disastrous degeneration.\nOver-population means strife and wars. The history of the rise and fall\nof many of the past civilizations has recorded a progressive rise,\nwhile civilizations were using the accumulated nutrition in the\ntopsoil, forest, shrubbery and grass, followed by a progressive\ndecline, while the same civilizations were reaping the results of the\ndestruction of these essential ultimate sources of life. Their cycle of\nrise and degeneration are strikingly duplicated in our present American\nculture.Various therapeutic measures in use today have come to us from\nprimitive peoples. One of the greatest scourges of the world is malaria\nfever. Everywhere it has been fought successfully with quinine. Indeed,\nmany parts of the world would not have been tenantable for whites\nwithout it. Yet few people realize that quinine was the gift of the\nancient Peruvian Indians.In Chapter 15 I presented data regarding the treatment used by\nseveral primitive races for preventing and correcting serious\ndisturbances in the digestive tract. This consisted in the use of clay\nor aluminum silicate which modern science has learned has the important\nquality of being able to adsorb and thus collect toxic substances and\nother products. Important new light is now thrown on the probable role\nof this substance in the primitive diet and its possible application in\nour modern problems of sensitization reactions or allergies. In the\nfirst volume of my work on \"Dental Infections,\" I presented data\nrelating toxic sensitization reactions to dental infections. These were\nshown in both animals and human beings. I discussed the relation of\nthese reactions to histamine and emphasized their similarity to the\neffect produced by inocculation with histamine. An important new\nchapter has recently. been added to this problem by the work of Dr. C.\nF. Code for which he has received an award by the American Association\nfor the Advancement of Science. He reported his findings before the\nAssociation meeting at Richmond, Virginia, in December, 1938. Dr. Code\nhas apparently discovered that histamine is the actual product\nresponsible for the symptoms of the various allergies. Its excess\naccumulation in the blood is the actual cause of the symptoms whether\nexpressed as asthma, hay fever or skin eruptions such as produced by\npollens, various foods, dust and other sensitizing agents. He has shown\nthat the eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, are the source of\nexcess histamine in the blood. It is accordingly indicated that the\nprimitive treatment by the use of kaolin, aluminum silicate, as an\nadsorbent was used directly for controlling such symptoms. It is now\nfurther indicated that this treatment can be helpful for the prevention\nof modern allergies. Previous investigations have shown that histamine\nis produced in the alimentary tract as a putrefaction product of\nproteins by the action of certain micro-organisms of the colon\ngroup.Modern science boasts the discovery of vitamin C, lack of which\ntook its toll of thousands of the white mariners through hundreds of\nyears with scurvy. The first recorded cure of that disease was made by\nthe Indians in Canada when the British soldiers were dying in large\nnumbers. The Indians taught them to use a tea made from the steeped\ntips of the shoots of the spruce. When I was among the Indians of the\nfar north I asked a chief why the Indians did not get scurvy. He then\nproceeded, as I have related in Chapter 15, to explain to me how the\nIndians prevented scurvy by the use of special organs in the animals.\nWhile it is true that we have come to associate the absence of vitamin\nC as the causative factor in scurvy, we do not know how many other\naffections may be due to its absence in adequate quantity in our foods.\nAlmost weekly, new diseases are being associated with vitamin\ndeficiencies in our modern dietaries.One of our modern tendencies is to select the foods we like,\nparticularly those that satisfy our hunger without our having to eat\nmuch, and, another is to think in terms of the few known vitamins and\ntheir effects. The primitive tendency seems to have been to provide an\nadequate factor of safety for all emergencies by the selection of a\nsufficient variety and quantity of the various natural foods to prevent\nentirely most of our modern affections. Their success demonstrates that\ntheir program is superior to ours. An important advance in modern\ninternational relationships provides for exchange of professorships\nand, thus, interchanges of wisdom. We have shown a most laudable and\nsympathetic interest in carrying our culture to the remnants of these\nprimitive races. Would it not be fortunate to accept in exchange\nlessons from their inherited knowledge? It may be not only our greatest\nopportunity, but our best hope for stemming the tide of our progressive\nbreakdown and also for our return to harmony with Nature's laws, since\nlife in its fullness is Nature obeyed.As I have sojourned among members of primitive racial stocks in\nseveral parts of the world, I have been deeply impressed with their\nfine personalities, and strong characters. I have never felt the\nslightest fear in being among them; I have never found that my trust in\nthem was misplaced. As soon as they had learned that I was visiting\nthem in their interest, their kindness and devotion was very\nremarkable. Fundamentally they are spiritual and have a devout\nreverence for an all-powerful, all-pervading power which not only\nprotects and provides for them, but accepts them as a part of that\ngreat encompassing soul if they obey Nature's laws.Ernest Thompson Seton has beautifully expressed the spirit of\nthe Indian in the opening paragraph of his little book \"The Gospel of\nthe Red Man\":The culture and civilization of the White man\nare essentially material; his measure of success is, \"How much property\nhave I acquired for myself?\" The culture of the Red man is\nfundamentally spiritual; his measure of success is, \"How much service\nhave I rendered to my people?\"The civilization of the White man is a failure;\nit is visibly crumbling around us. It has failed at every crucial test.\nNo one who measures things by results can question this fundamental\nstatement.The faith of the primitive in the all-pervading power of which\nhe is a part includes a belief in immortality. He lives in communion\nwith the great unseen Spirit, of which he is a part, always in humility\nand reverence. Elizabeth Odell in the following lines seems to express\nthe spirit of the primitives,Flat outstretched upon a moundOf earth I lie; I press my earAgainst its surface and I hearFar off and deep, the measured soundOf heart that beats within the ground.And with it pounds in harmonyThe swift, familiar heart in me.They pulse as one, together swell,Together fall; I cannot tellMy sound from earth's, for I am partOf rhythmic, universal heart.REFERENCESJACOBSON, A.

In every\ninstance where individuals of the same racial stocks who had lost this\nisolation and who had adopted the foods and food habits of our modern\ncivilization were examined, there was an early loss of the high\nimmunity characteristics of the isolated group.

The percentage of\nindividuals so affected in our American communities in which I have\nmade studies varies through a wide range, usually between 25 per cent\nto 75 per cent. A certain percentage of this affected group has not\nonly these evidences of physical injury, but also personality\ndisturbances, the most common of which is a lower than normal mental\nefficiency and acuteness, chiefly observed as so-called mental\nbackwardness which includes the group of children in the schools who\nare unable to keep up with their classmates. Their I.Q.'s are generally\nlower than normal and they readily develop inferiority complexes\ngrowing out of their handicap. From this group or parallel with it a\ncertain percentage develop personality disturbances which have their\nexpression largely in unsocial traits. They include the delinquents who\nat this time are causing so much trouble and concern because of\nevidence of increase in their numbers. This latter group has been\naccounted for largely on the basis of some conditioning experience that\ndeveloped after the child had reached an impressionable age. My\ninvestigations are revealing a physical structural change and\ntherefore, an organic factor which precedes and underlies these\nconditioning influences of the environment. The fact that a government\nsurvey has shown that 66 per cent of the delinquents who have been\ntreated in the best institutions and released as cured, later have\ndeveloped their unsocial or criminal tendencies, strongly emphasizes\nthe urgent necessity that if preventive methods are to be applied these\nmust precede and forestall the primary injuries themselves.",

The blending of racial stocks that\ndiffer radically in facial form has been said by many to be the chief\nfactor contributing to the creation of deformities of the face. Crowded\nteeth have been said to be due to the inheritance of the large teeth of\none parent and the small bone formation of the other and that such\ninheritances would provide dental arches that are too small for the\nteeth that have been made for them. A more general explanation for\ncertain types of deformity, particularly for the protruding of the\nupper teeth over the lower, is that they result from thumb sucking,\nwhich tends to bring the upper arch forward and to depress the lower.\nAmong the other contributing factors named have been faulty sleeping\nand breathing habits. To these has been assigned much of the blame.\nThis problem of facial form, as well as that of bodily design,\nincluding dental arch design, is so directly a problem of growth, not\nonly of individuals, but of races themselves, that certain laws have\nbeen very definitely worked out by physical anthropologists as laws of\ndevelopment. They have assumed that changes in physical type can occur\nonly through the impact of changes in the environment which have\naffected a great number of generations.

The pot to the right shows\nthe result of planting the oats in a sandy soil almost like that of the\nIslands of the Outer Hebrides. The oats only grew to the fuzzy limited\ncondition shown.

The American Indian,\ntherefore, provides a very remarkable opportunity to study both the\ncapacity for adaptability to different environments and the variations\nthat different environments can produce in a single racial stock.

At first thought it might\nseem impossible that such groups can exist, but as a matter of fact\nthere are still great areas of the American continent inhabited by the\noriginal stock living in areas still unexplored. In order to find\nIndians as little changed as possible by reason of their contact with\nthe white man, particularly with the white man's foods, I went to\nnorthern Canada to the region inside the Rocky Mountain range to study\nthe Indians of Northern British Columbia and the Yukon territory. Since\nan aeroplane could not be used, owing to the lack of a base of supplies\nfor fuel for the return trip; and since the MacKenzie water route was\nimpracticable (an expedition could not go up the waterways through\nCanada on the MacKenzie River and its branches and return the same\nseason), the route selected was that which enters that territory from\nAlaska on the large waterway of the Stikine River. This river has cut\nits channel through the Coast and Cascade Ranges of mountains and has\nits origin in the high western watershed of the Rockies. It was\nparticularly desirable to reach a group of Indians who could not obtain\nthe animal life of the sea, not even the running salmon. These fish do\nnot enter the waterways draining to the Arctic. We used a high-powered\nriver transport specially designed for going up rapids on the Stikine\nRiver to the end of navigation at Telegraph Creek. At this point large\nquantities of modern foods are stored during the short open navigation\nseason of the summer to be exchanged for furs during the long winter. A\nHudson Bay Post has been established at this point. Here a truck was\nchartered which took us over a trail across the Rocky Mountain Divide\nto the headwaters of the rivers flowing north to the Arctic. At this\noutpost two guides were engaged and a high powered scow chartered to\nmake the trip down the waterways toward the Arctic on the Diese and\nLiard Rivers. This made it possible, in the summer of 1933, to make\ncontact with large bands of Indians who had come out of the Pelly\nmountain country to exchange their catch of furs at the last outpost of\nthe Hudson Bay Company. Most of the Indians of Canada are under treaty\nwith the Canadian Government whereby that government gives them an\nannual per capita bounty. This arrangement induces the Indians in the\ninterior to come out to the designated centers to obtain the bounty.\nSince it is based on the number in the family, all of the children are\nbrought. This treaty, however, was never signed by the Indians of the\nBritish Columbia and Yukon Territory. And, accordingly, they have\nremained as nomadic wandering tribes following the moose and caribou\nherds in the necessary search to obtain their foods.",

They still lived on the wild animal game of\nthe land. As in the northern country just reviewed, their principal\nlarge animal was the moose. These are treaty Indians, and many of them\ncome out to this frontier to obtain the government bounty and,\naccordingly, were obliged to bring their families. The bounty here\namounted to five dollars per head, a considerable income in exchange\nfor blankets and other equipment. Some of these contact points were at\nthe height of the land dividing the waters running north and east to\nJames Bay and Hudson Bay, or south to Lake Superior. This was historic\ncountry that had been the meeting ground of the tribes of the northern\nwaters with the tribes of the Great Lakes district. Many battles had\nbeen fought there. For comparison with these more primitive groups from\nthe Hudson and James Bay watershed, I had the opportunity here of\nstudying families that had taken up residence along the railroad or in\nits vicinity in order that they might have the advantage of exchanging\nfurs for the modern white man's foods.

They could go to one of the piers at almost any time of\nthe year and catch fish or secure them as they had been accustomed to\ndo before the arrival of modern foods, but there is a constant striving\nto be like and live like the white people.

We will, accordingly, consider the dental\ncaries problem and that of facial and dental arch form in the Florida\nIndians by comparing three groups: namely, the pre-Columbian, as\nevidenced from a study of the skull material in the museums; the tribes\nof Indians living in as much isolation as is possible in the Everglades\nand Cypress Swamps; and the Indians of the same stock that are living\nin contact with the foods of modern civilization. This latter group\nlives along the Tamiami trail and near Miami. In a study of several\nhundred skulls taken from the burial mounds of southern Florida, the\nincidence of tooth decay was so low as to constitute an immunity of\napparently one hundred per cent, since in several hundred skulls not a\nsingle tooth was found to have been attacked by tooth decay. Dental\narch deformity and the typical change in facial form due to an\ninadequate nutrition were also completely absent, all dental arches\nhaving a form and interdental relationship such as to bring them into\nthe classification of normal. These are illustrated in Figs. 22 and 23.\nThe problem of reaching the isolated groups living in the depth of the\nCypress Swamps was complicated by the fact that these people had a\ndread of all whites growing out of their belief that they had been\ngrossly taken advantage of in some of their early efforts to make a\ntreaty with the whites. With the assistance of three guides, one, an\nIndian of their own group, another, a white man whom they trusted, and\nthe third, a government nurse who had been very helpful in case of\nsickness, we were able to take the desired measurements and records and\nphotographs. A group of these more primitive representatives is shown\nin Fig. 24. While their hunting territory had been grossly encroached\nupon by the white hunters, they were still able to maintain a very high\ndegree of physical excellence and high immunity to dental caries. Only\nfour teeth in each hundred examined were found to have been attacked by\ntooth decay.",

I was not able, however, to get beyond the piles of sea shells\nwhich had been carried into the interior. My guide told me that it had\nalways been essential, as it is today, for the people of the interior\nto obtain some food from the sea, and that even during the times of\nmost bitter warfare between the inland or hill tribes and the coast\ntribes, those of the interior would bring down during the night choice\nplant foods from the mountain areas and place them in caches and return\nthe following night and obtain the sea foods that had been placed in\nthose depositories by the shore tribes. The individuals who carried\nthese foods were never molested, not even during active warfare. He\ntold me further that they require food from the sea at least every\nthree months, even to this day.

These\nwere not native, but imported into nearly all of the islands, and they\nhave become wild where there is an abundance of food for them. Another\nanimal food was that from coconut crabs which grow to a weight of\nseveral pounds. At certain seasons of the year the crabs migrate to the\nsea in great numbers from the mountains and interior country. They\nspend about three days in the sea for part of their reproductive\nprogram and return later to their mountain habitats. Their routes of\ntravel are as nearly as possible in straight lines. At the season of\nmigration, large numbers of the crabs are captured for food. These\ncrabs rob the coconut trees of fruit. They climb the trees during the\ndarkness and return to the ground before the dawn. They cut off the\ncoconuts and allow them to drop to the ground. When the natives hear\ncoconuts dropping in the night they put a girdle of grass around the\ntree fifteen or twenty feet from the ground, and when the crabs back\ndown and touch the grass they think that they are down on the ground,\nlet go their hold and are stunned by the fall. The natives then collect\nthe crabs and put them in a pen where they are fed on shredded coconut.\nIn two weeks' time the crabs are so fat that they burst their shells.\nThey are then very delicious eating. Fresh water fish of various kinds\nare used where available from the mountain streams.

Few, if\nany, of the primitive racial stocks of the South Sea Islands were so\nenthusiastically extolled for their beauty and excellence of physical\ndevelopment by the early navigators. Much tooth decay prevails today.\nThey reported the Marquesans as vivacious, happy people numbering over\na hundred thousand on the seven principal islands of this group.\nProbably in few places in the world can so distressing a picture be\nseen today as is found there. A French government official told me that\nthe native population had decreased to about two thousand, chiefly as a\nresult of the ravages of tuberculosis. Serious epidemics of small-pox\nand measles have at times taken a heavy toll. In a group of\napproximately one hundred adults and children I counted ten who were\nemaciated and coughing with typical signs of tuberculosis. Many were\nwaiting for treatment at a dispensary eight hours before the hour it\nopened. In the past some of the natives have had splendid physiques,\nfine countenances, and some of the women have had beautiful features.\nThey are now a sick and dying primitive group. A trader ship was in\nport exchanging white flour and sugar for their copra. They have\nlargely ceased to depend on the sea for food. Tooth decay was rampant.\nAt the time of the examination, 36.9 per cent of the teeth of the\npeople using trade food in conjunction with the land plants and fruits\nhad been attacked by tooth decay. The individuals living entirely on\nnative foods were few. Some early navigators were so highly impressed\nwith the beauty and health of these people that they reported the\nMarquesas Islands as the Garden of Eden. Tahiti is the principal island\nof the Society group. It is situated 17 degrees south of the equator,\n149 degrees west longitude. Fortunately degeneration has not been so\nrapid nor so severe here. The Tahitian population, however, has reduced\nfrom over two hundred thousand as early estimated, to a present native\npopulation estimated at about ten thousand. These islands are also a\npart of French Oceania. Many of the able bodied men were taken from\nthese French Islands to France to fight in the World War. Only a small\npercentage, however, returned, and they were mostly crippled and\nmaimed. The Tahitians are a buoyant, light-hearted race, fully\nconscious, however, of their rapid decline in numbers and health. Many\nof the more primitive are very fine looking and have excellent dental\narches, as seen in Fig. 33.",

Another great racial movement has apparently moved southward\nfrom Northern Africa. These tribes are of Hamitic origin and include\nNilotic tribes and Abyssinians. The Nilotic tribes have a distinct\nphysical pattern and mode of life. These great racial movements have\nmet in the Upper Nile region of Eastern Africa near the equator, and\nhave swayed back and forth with successive obliteration or absorption\nof those tribes that were least sturdy. The negro race occupied an area\nacross Africa from the West to Central Africa. They were exposed to the\naggression and oppression of these two great racial movements,\nresulting often in intermingling in various proportions of racial\nbloods. The Semitic race, chiefly Arabs, occupied Arabia and a great\narea in Northern Africa.",

    "text": "I saw the native Masai operating on their cattle with skill and\nknowledge. The Masai have no currency and all their transactions are\nmade with cows or goats. A valuable cow was not eating properly, and I\nobserved them taking a thorn out of the inside of her mouth. The\nsurgical operation was done with a knife of their own making and\ntempered by pounding. The wound was treated by rubbing it with the\nashes of a plant that acted as a very powerful styptic. Their knowledge\nof veterinary science is quite remarkable. I saw them treating a young\ncow that had failed to conceive. They apparently knew the cause and\nproceeded to treat her as modern veterinaries might do in order to\novercome her difficulties. For their food throughout the centuries they\nhave depended very largely on milk, meat and blood, reinforced with\nvegetables and fruits. They milk the cows daily and bleed the steers at\nregular intervals by a unique process. In Fig. 40 we see a native Masai\nwith his bow and arrow, the latter tipped with a sharp knife which is\nguarded by a shoulder to determine the depth to which the arrow may\nenter the vein. If the animal is sufficiently tame, the blood is drawn\nwhile it is standing. If the animal is frightened it is quickly\nhobbled, as shown below. In this figure the stream of blood may be seen\nspurting from the jugular vein into a gourd which holds about a gallon.\nA torque is placed around the neck before the puncture is made. The\nanimals did not even flinch when struck by the arrow, the operation is\ndone so quickly and skillfully. When sufficient blood was drawn, the\ntorque was removed and the blood immediately stopped flowing. A styptic\nmade of ashes referred to above was used. This serves also to protect\nthe wound from infection. The blood is defibrinated by whipping in the\ngourd. The fibrin is fried or cooked much as bacon or meat would be\nprepared. The defibrinated blood is used raw just as the milk is,\nexcept in smaller quantities. When available, each growing child\nreceives a day's ration of blood as does each pregnant or lactating\nwoman. Formerly, the warriors used this food exclusively. These three\nsources, milk, blood and meat provide them with liberal supplies of\nbody-building minerals and the special vitamins, both fat-soluble and\nwater soluble. Their estimate of a desirable dairy stock is based on\nquality not quantity. They judge the value of a cow for keeping in\ntheir herd by the length of time it takes her calf to stand on its feet\nand run after it is born, which is only a very few minutes. This is in\nstriking contrast with the practice of our modern dairymen who are\nchiefly concerned with the quantity of milk and quantity of butter fat\nrather than with its value as a source of special factors for\nnutrition. Many of the calves of the modern high-production cows of\ncivilized countries are not able to stand for many hours after birth,\nfrequently twenty-four. This ability to stand is very important in a\ncountry infested with predatory animals; such as lions, leopards,\nhyenas, jackals and vultures.",

In one district in Uganda two hundred were\nsaid to have been slaughtered. They are very destructive to banana\nplantations. They break the banana trees over or pull them up by the\nroots and eat the succulent heart as well as the fruits. In a night a\nherd may destroy an entire plantation. The only people in the districts\nwho are permitted to kill the elephants without license are the\npygmies. They are also the only ones not required to pay a head tax.\nThere are many tribes of them in the great forest area in Belgian Congo\nand Uganda. Their skill with spears is remarkable and they are able to\nkill an elephant while the animal remains unaware of his danger. It\ntakes them one to two days to hamstring an elephant by working\nstealthily from behind, always keeping out of the elephant's sight.\nAlthough an elephant can scent a human for a long distance, these\npygmies can disguise themselves so completely that the elephant is\nunaware of their presence. After disabling him by cutting the tendons\nof both hind legs, they attack him openly and, while one attracts his\nattention, the other slowly but progressively hacks off his trunk. In\nthis manner he bleeds to death. They are particularly fond of elephant\nmeat and a slaughter means a great feast. While we were in one of the\npygmy colonies two of them brought in the tusks of an elephant they had\njust killed. We had the rare opportunity of witnessing the celebration\nin the colony, which included the special reproduction in pantomime of\nthe attack and method of killing the elephant. The pygmy mother of\nthese two men is shown in Fig. 43 (lower half). It will be noticed that\nshe is a full head shorter than Mrs. Price, who is five feet three\ninches tall. This rugged, though small, woman is the mother of five\ngrown men, two of whom are shown in Fig. 43 with the tusks of the\nelephant. Note their homemade spears. As marksmen with bows and arrows\nand as trappers, these pygmies have wonderful skill. Their arrows are\ntipped with iron of their own manufacture and have receptacles for\ncarrying drugs which they extract from plants. These drugs temporarily\nparalyze the animals. For animals which they wish to destroy the arrows\ncarry a poison which rapidly produces death. The home life of the\npygmies in the forest is often filled with danger. Just before our\narrival two babies had been carried off by a leopard. This stealthy\nnight prowler is one of the most difficult animals to combat and\nprobably has been one of the reasons the pygmies build cabins in the\ntrees. Ordinarily their homes are built on the ground in a little\nclearing in the big forest. They consist of low shelters covered with\nbanana leaves and other plants, built over a frame work. The native\nmissionary dispensed our gift of salt which is one of their most prized\ngifts. They put on a dance for us.",

Many of the animal species that are\nabundant in Australia are found only in fossil form on other\ncontinents. The evidence indicates that they crossed on a land bridge\nwhich connected Australia with Asia. After the bridge was submerged the\nanimals persisted in that protected island continent which never has\nknown any of the animal species of later development. Among these\nanimals the marsupials play an important role and constitute a large\nvariety. The American continent has only one or two of the many forms\nfound in Australia. These are the opossum of the marsupial family and\nthe sloth. One of the most curious animals living on the earth today,\nor that has left its remains in the petrified skeletons of early\nperiods of the earth's history, is the duckbill platypus. It has the\nunique distinction of having the characteristics of several animal\nspecies. It lays eggs like a bird and hatches them with the heat of its\nbody in its pouch. It has webbed, five-toed feet, like the water birds,\na bill like a duck and hair and tail like a beaver. The typical\nmarsupial pouch for carrying its young, is another characteristic of\nthis strange animal. Like other mammals it provides milk for its young.\nIts milk is similar in chemical constituents to that of other mammals.\nMost rudimentary in form are the mammary glands of the platypus. The\nyoung, when hatched in the pouch, nuzzle the lining membrane of the\npouch and the milk exudes through minute openings. There is no nipple.\nThe animal lives chiefly in the water. Its home is built above the\nwater level on the bank, but the entrance to it is underneath the\nwater. They are exceedingly playful creatures, apparently more at home\nin the water than on land. They live on both animal life and plant food\nfound under the water. They seem to be related to an early era of\ndifferentiation of animal species.",

Note also in this connection that the natives of this island\nare conscious of the superior food of their locality and wish that\ntheir people were not required to purchase food from the government\nstore. The island is situated on the Barrier Reef and has an abundant\nsupply of small fish. The swarms of fish are often so dense that the\nnatives throw a spear with several prongs into the school of fish and\nwhen the spear is drawn back, there are several fish on it. This\ncondition provides abundant food for sharks many of which could be seen\nsurrounding the schools of small fish. Encircling the group, they\ndashed in, mouths open and gorged themselves with the mass of fish from\nthe water. It seemed quite remarkable that the people were willing to\ngo into the water to spear the fish within the zone frequently\napproached by the sharks, but I was told by the natives that when the\nfish are so abundant the sharks never attack human beings. One of the\nnatives rowed me in his canoe to a point where I could photograph the\nsharks at close range. To show his disdain for the shark, he had no\nhesitancy in standing up in the end of the canoe and hurling his spear\ninto the side of the monster. The spear was immediately thrown out by\nthe shark, which had not been frightened sufficiently to make it leave\nthe scene of action. The sharks in my pictures were swimming so close\nto the shore that the upper part of the tail was forced out of the\nwater, also the back fin, in order to clear the bottom. It was a great\nrevelation to watch the movement of the tail. Instead of swinging it\nfrom side to side like other fish, with which I was familiar, the shark\nwould rotate its tail half or three quarters of a turn in a motion like\nthat of a propeller of a boat, then reverse the motion for the return\ntrip. By a sudden increase of speed in this motion, the shark could\ndart ahead at a rapid rate, corral the small fish by encircling them,\nand finally make a dash through the school with its mouth open.\nHundreds of the small fish, in order to escape, dart out of the water\ninto the air. This exposes them to the birds, a flock of which follows\nthe sharks when they are feeding on the fish. The birds dive down at\nthe time they see the shark making his raid and catch the small fish as\nthey dart out of the water. It is by the birds of prey that the native\nfishermen from their lookout locate the schools of fish.

Since\nthe West Coast of South America has been the home of several ancient\ncultures, it is important that they be included with the living\nremnants of primitive racial stocks, in order to note the contributions\nthat they may make to the problem of modern degeneration. The\nrelationship between the Andes Mountain Range and the coast and the sea\ncurrents is such that there has been created a zone, ranging from forty\nto one hundred miles in width between the coast and the mountains,\nwhich for a distance of over a thousand miles is completely arid. The\nair currents drifting westward across South America from the Atlantic\ncarry an abundance of moisture. When they strike the eastern foothills\nof the Andes they are projected upward into a region of constant cold\nwhich causes the moisture to be precipitated as rain on the eastern\nslopes, and as snow on the eastern Cordillera Range. Hence the name of\nthe eastern range is the White Cordillera, and that of the western\nrange, which receives little of this rain, is the Black Cordillera.\nBetween these two ranges is a great plain, which in the rainy season is\nwell watered. The great civilizations of the past have always utilized\nwater from the melting snow through irrigation ditches with the result\nthat a vast acreage was put to agricultural uses.",

    "text": "The Humboldt Current which sweeps northward from the southern\nice fields and carries its chilly water almost to the equator has\ninfluenced the development of the West Coast of South America. The\neffect of the current on the climate is generally noticeable. One of\nthe conspicuous results is the presence of a cloud bank which hovers\nover the coastal area at an altitude of from one thousand to three\nthousand feet above sea level for several months of the year. Back from\nthe coast these clouds rest on the land and constitute a nearly\nconstant fog for extended periods. When one passes inland from the\ncoast up the mountains he moves from a zone which in winter is clammy\nand chilly, into the fog zone, and then suddenly out of it into clear\nsky and brilliant sunlight. It is of interest that the capital, Lima,\nis so situated that it suffers from this unhappy cloud and fog\nsituation. When Pizarro sent a commission to search out a location for\nhis capital city the natives commented on the fact that he was\nselecting a very undesirable location. Either on the coast or farther\ninland than Lima the climate is much more favorable, and these were the\nlocations in which the ancient civilizations have left some very\nelaborate foundations of fortresses and extended residential areas. The\ngreat expanse of desert extending from the coast to the mountains, with\nits great moving sand dunes and with scarcely a sign of green life, is\none of the least hospitable environments that any culture could choose.\nNotwithstanding this, the entire coast is a succession of ancient\nburial mounds in which it is estimated that there are fifteen million\nmummies in an excellent state of preservation. The few hundred thousand\nthat have been disturbed by grave robbers in search of gold and silver,\nhave been left bleaching on the sands. Where had these people come from\nand why were they buried here? The answer is to be found in the fact\nthat probably few locations in the world provided such an inexhaustible\nsupply of food for producing a good culture as did this area. The lack\nof present appreciation of this fact is evidenced by the absence of\nflourishing modern communities, notwithstanding the almost continuous\nchain of ancient walls, fortresses, habitations, and irrigation systems\nto be found along this coast. The Humboldt Current coming from the ice\nfields of the Antarctic carries with it a prodigious quantity of the\nchemical food elements that are most effective in the production of a\nvast population of fish. Probably no place in the world provides as\ngreat an area teeming with marine life. The ancient cultures\nappreciated the value of these sea foods and utilized them to the full.\nThey realized also that certain land plants should be eaten with the\nsea foods. Accordingly, they constructed great aqueducts used in\ntransporting the water, sometimes a hundred miles, for the purpose of\nirrigating river bottoms which had been collecting the alluvial soil\nfrom the Andes through past ages. These river beds are to be found from\ntwenty to fifty miles apart and many of them are entirely dry except in\nthe rainy season in the high Andes. In the river bottoms these ancient\ncultures grew large quantities of corn, beans, squash, and other\nplants. These plant foods were gathered, stored, and eaten with sea\nfoods. The people on the coast had direct communication with the people\nin the high plateaus. It is of more than passing interest that some\ntwenty-one of our modern food plants apparently came from Peru.",

This culture took its\nname from the ruling emperors called Incas. The capital of their, great\nkingdom was Cuzco, a city located between the East and West Cordillera\nRanges of the Andes. These parallel ranges are from fifty to two\nhundred miles apart. Between them is situated a great plateau ranging\nfrom 10,000 to 13,000 feet above the sea. The mountain ranges are\nsnow-capped and include in Peru alone fifty peaks that are over 18,000\nfeet in altitude, ranging up to 22,185 feet in Mount Huascaran. Only\nMount Aconcagua in Chile is higher. It is 23,075 feet--the highest\nmountain in the Americas. The air drift is across South America from\neast to west, carrying vast quantities of water received by evaporation\nfrom the Atlantic Ocean. This moisture is precipitated rapidly when the\nclouds are forced into the chill of the higher Andes. In the rainy\nseason the great plateau area is frequently well watered, though not in\nsufficient quantity to meet the needs of agriculture for much of the\nterritory. In the past the precipitation has been supplemented by vast\nirrigation projects using the water from the melting snows. It is\nestimated that the population ruled over by the reigning Incas at the\ntime of the coming of the Spaniards reached five millions.",

The Urabamba\nRiver drains a large area of the plateau lying to the south of Cuzco\nand has cut a magnificent gorge through the southern range of the Andes\nwhere it passes from the plateau to the eastern watershed and thence to\nthe Amazon. A little to the south of Cuzco the eastern and the western\nranges of mountains approach and combine in a cluster of magnificent\npinnacles and intervening valleys and gorges, that are to be equalled\nby no mountain scenery in the world. Today, almost all travel from the\nAndean Plateau north of this region, as well as from all areas along\nthe coast, must proceed to the coast, thence down the coast by boat to\nthe port of Mollendo which is often dangerous or impossible of approach\nbecause of the heavy seas. The journey is made by train up through\nArequipa and over the western Cordillera Range of the Andes into the\nplateau country and from there northward to Cuzco. So great is this\nnatural barrier that the detour requires many days, and the crossing of\nseveral divides ranging from fourteen to sixteen thousand feet above\nthe sea. This was not necessary for the Incas who had built roads and\nsuspension bridges through these mountains from Cuzco to all parts of\nthe great empire. It is in this mountain vastness that the Inca rulers\nhad constructed their most superb fortresses.

    "text": "The only native domesticated animals of the Andean Plateau are\nthe llama and the alpaca. Both of these belong to the camel species, as\ndoes the vicuna. The llama is the Indians' beast of burden in the\nAndes. Only the males are used. The animals are very docile and respond\nwith gentleness when treated with kindness. One continually marvels at\nthe ease with which the Indian guides his loaded caravan with soft\nwords or motions, never with harshness. The llama has many unique\nfeatures as a beast of burden. It forages as it moves along and\nconsequently must be driven very slowly. Each animal will carry a\nburden not exceeding a hundred pounds, and if more is placed on its\nback it will immediately lie down until the extra burden is removed.\nThe llama has broad doubletoed feet like the camel which make it very\nsure-footed. It requires no shoeing and exceedingly little care. It can\nthrive, however, only in the high altitudes. The wool of the llama is\ncoarse and is used for heavy, rough garments. The alpaca is a little\nsmaller than the llama and produces a very heavy wool of fine quality.\nAccustomed as this animal is to the severe cold and the high altitudes,\nas well as to the rain and sun, its fleece is both durable and warm. It\nis used extensively throughout the world for suits for aviators. The\nnative colors vary from white to bluish tints and from light to very\ndark browns. It accordingly provides very stable colors for weaving\ndirectly into ponchos and native apparel. The vicuna is a much smaller\nanimal than either the llama or alpaca. It has one of the most highly\nprized coats of fur produced anywhere in the world. This animal has\nnever been domesticated; vast herds have lived wild on the high slopes\nof the Andes mountains. The demand for vicuna fur became so great that\na million and a half of these animals were slain in one year to obtain\ntheir fur pelts. The result is that the Peruvian Government has now\ncompletely forbidden their destruction. The garments of the ruling\nclass of the Incas were made of the vicuna wool.",

    "text": "While the coastal area of Peru saw the development of many\nmagnificent cultures through past ages, the highlands of Peru also have\nleft much evidence of superior attainments and wisdom. The two great\nIndian linguistic groups of the Andean highlands of today are the\nAymara of Southern Peru and Bolivia and the Quichus of central and\nnorthern Peru. The Aymara are credited with being the descendants of\nthe Tauhuanocan culture which preceded the Incan culture in the\nhighlands. The Quichu are credited with being the descendants of the\nIncan culture which had its zenith just prior to the coming of the\nSpaniards. In Chapter 14 I have shown photographs of these racial\nstocks as they are found today in the Andean Sierras. It may be\npossible that in former times the vast mountain ranges provided large\nherds of grazing wild animals of the deer family. Because of the\nvastness of the population and the extent to which all available land\nsurfaces were utilized for agriculture, it does not seem possible that\nwild animal life could have been an adequate source of nutrition. The\nmembers of the camel family, the llamas, alpacas, and vicunas were\nutilized for food. Of these the first two were used to considerable\nextent as they are today. When it is recognized that in the Sierra the\navailable water is largely that provided to the streams from the\nmelting snows and from rains in the rainy season, it will be realized\nthat these sources of fresh water could not provide the liberal\nquantity of iodine essential for human growth and development. It was,\naccordingly, a matter of great interest to discover that these Indians\nused regularly dried fish eggs from the sea. Commerce in these dried\nfoods is carried on today as it no doubt has been for centuries. When I\ninquired of them why they used this material they explained that it was\nnecessary to maintain the fertility of their women. I was informed also\nthat every exchange depot and market carried these dried fish eggs so\nthat they were always available. Another sea product of very great\nimportance, and one which was universally available was dried kelp.\nUpon inquiry I learned that the Indians used it so that they would not\nget \"big necks\" like the whites. The kelp provided a very rich source\nof iodine as well as of copper, which is very important to them in the\nutilization of iron for building an exceptionally efficient quality of\nblood for carrying oxygen liberally at those high altitudes. An\nimportant part of their dietary consists today as in the past of\npotatoes which are gathered and frozen, dried and powdered, and\npreserved in the powdered form. This powder is used in soups with llama\nmeat and other products. Since the vitamin D group of activators is\nabsent from nearly all plant products but must be synthesized in animal\nbodies from the plant foods, where it is largely stored in organs, an\nadequate source had to be provided. The Indians of the highlands of\nPeru maintained colonies of guinea pigs which were used in their stews.\nThe ancient burials also show that the guinea pig was a common source\nof food since mummified bodies of this animal were found. This is\nsignificant since of all the animals that are used for experimental\nwork the guinea pig is probably the most efficient in synthesizing\nvitamin D from plant foods. They are very hardy. They live on a great\nvariety of green plant foods and twigs and are very prolific. They\napparently played a very important part in the physical excellence of\nthe ancient cultures.",

The child was not dead although almost constantly in\nconvulsions. He thought the condition was probably nutritional and\nasked if he could bring the boy to the office immediately. The boy was\nbadly emaciated, had rampant tooth decay, one leg in a cast, a very bad\nbronchial cough and was in and out of convulsions in rapid succession.\nHis convulsions had been getting worse progressively during the past\neight months. His leg had been fractured two or three months previously\nwhile walking across the room when he fell in one of his convulsions.\nNo healing had occurred. His diet consisted of white bread and skimmed\nmilk. For mending the fracture the boy needed minerals, calcium,\nphosphorus and magnesium. His convulsions were due to a low calcium\ncontent of the blood. All of these were in the skimmed milk for the\nbutter-fat removed in the cream contains no calcium nor phosphorus,\nexcept traces. The program provided was a change from the white flour\nbread to wheat gruel made from freshly ground wheat and the\nsubstitution of whole milk for skimmed milk, with the addition of about\na teaspoonful of a very high vitamin butter with each feeding. He was\ngiven this meal that evening when he returned to his home. He slept all\nnight without a convulsion. He was fed the same food five times the\nnext day and did not have a convulsion. He proceeded rapidly to regain\nhis health without recurrence of his convulsions. In a month the\nfracture was united. Two views of the fracture are shown in Fig. 93,\none before and one after the treatment.

    "text": "From the data presented in the preceding chapters and in this\ncomparison of the primitive and modernized dietaries it is obvious that\nthere is great need that the grains eaten shall contain all the\nminerals and vitamins which Nature has provided that they carry.\nImportant data might be presented to illustrate this phase in a\npractical way. In Fig. 95 will be seen three rats all of which received\nthe same diet, except for the type of bread. The first rat (at the\nleft) received whole-wheat products freshly ground, the center one\nreceived a white flour product and the third (at the right) a bran and\nmiddlings product. The amounts of each ash, of calcium as the oxide,\nand of phosphorus as the pentoxide; and the amounts of iron and copper\npresent in the diet of each group are shown by the height of the\ncolumns beneath the rats. Clinically it will be seen that there is a\nmarked difference in the physical development Qf these rats. Several\nrats of the same age were in each cage. The feeding was started after\nweaning at about twenty-three days of age. The rat at the left was on\nthe entire grain product. It was fully developed. The rats in this cage\nreproduced normally at three months of age. The rats in this first cage\nhad very mild dispositions and could be picked up by the ear or tail\nwithout danger of their biting. The rats represented by the one in the\ncenter cage using white flour were markedly undersized. Their hair came\nout in large patches and they had very ugly dispositions, so ugly that\nthey threatened to spring through the cage wall at us when we came to\nlook at them. These rats had tooth decay and they were not able to\nreproduce. The rats in the next cage (illustrated by the rat to the\nright) which were on the bran and middlings mixture did not show tooth\ndecay, but were considerably undersized, and they lacked energy. The\nflour and middlings for the rats in cages two and three were purchased\nfrom the miller and hence were not freshly ground. The wheat given to\nthe first group was obtained whole and ground while fresh in a hand\nmill. It is of interest that notwithstanding the great increase in ash,\ncalcium, phosphorus, iron and copper present in the foods of the last\ngroup, the rats did not mature normally, as did those in the first\ngroup. This may have been due in large part to the fact that the\nmaterial was not freshly ground, and as a result they could not obtain\na normal vitamin content from the embryo of the grain due to its\noxidation. This is further indicated by the fact that the rats in this\ngroup did not reproduce, probably due in considerable part to a lack of\nvitamins B and E which were lost by oxidation of the embryo or germ\nfat.",

They had gone\ninto the district, which at that time was still uncharted and\nunsurveyed, to prospect for precious metals and radium. They were both\ndoctors of engineering and science, and had been sent with very\nelaborate equipment from one of the large national mining corporations.\nOwing to the inaccessibility of the region, they adopted a plan for\nreaching it quickly. They had flown across the two ranges of mountains\nfrom Alaska and when they arrived at the inside range, i.e., the Rocky\nMountain Range, they found the altitude so high that their plane could\nnot fly over the range, and, as a result, they were brought down on a\nlittle lake outside. The plane then returned but was unable to reach\nthe outside world because of shortage of fuel. The pilot had to leave\nit on a waterway and trudge over the mountains to civilization. The two\nprospectors undertook to carry their equipment and provisions over the\nRocky Mountain Range into the interior district where they were to\nprospect. They found the distance across the plateau to be about one\nhundred miles and the elevation ranging up to nine thousand feet. While\nthey had provisions and equipment to stay two years they found it would\ntake all of this time to carry their provisions and instruments across\nthis plateau. They accordingly abandoned everything, and rather than\nremain in the country with very uncertain facilities and prospects for\nobtaining food and shelter, made a forced march to the Liard River with\nthe hope that some expedition might be in that territory. One of the\nmen told me the following tragic story. While they were crossing the\nhigh plateau he nearly went blind with so violent a pain in his eyes\nthat he feared he would go insane. It was not snow blindness, for they\nwere equipped with glasses. It was xeropthalmia, due to lack of vitamin\nA. One day he almost ran into a mother grizzly bear and her two cubs.\nFortunately, they did not attack him but moved off. He sat down on a\nstone and wept in despair of ever seeing his family again. As he sat\nthere holding his throbbing head, he heard a voice and looked up. It\nwas an old Indian who had been tracking that grizzly bear. He\nrecognized this prospector's plight and while neither could understand\nthe language of the other, the Indian after making an examination of\nhis eyes, took him by the hand and led him to a stream that was\ncoursing its way down the mountain. Here as the prospector sat waiting\nthe Indian built a trap of stones across the stream. He then went\nupstream and waded down splashing as he came and thus drove the trout\ninto the trap. He threw the fish out on the bank and told the\nprospector to eat the flesh of the head and the tissues back of the\neyes, including the eyes, with the result that in a few hours his pain\nhad largely subsided. In one day his sight was rapidly returning, and\nin two days his eyes were nearly normal. He told me with profound\nemotion and gratitude that that Indian had certainly saved his\nlife.",

Teeth never have caries while they are covered\nwith flesh but decay most easily soon after eruption, when conditions\nare unfavorable.

    "text": "The tooth is made up of four structures. The first is the pulp\nwithin, which carries blood vessels and nerves. This structure is\nsurrounded in both the root and crown by the dentine or tooth bone\nwhich is nourished from within. The dentine of the root is covered by\ncementum which receives nourishment from the membrane which attaches\nthe root to the jaw bone. The dentine of the crown or exposed part of\nthe tooth is covered with enamel. Tooth decay proceeds slowly through\nthe enamel and often rapidly in the dentine, always following the\nminute channels toward the pulp, which may become infected before the\ndecay actually reaches the pulp to expose it; nearly always the decay\ninfects the pulp when it destroys the dentine covering it. When a tooth\nhas a deep cavity of decay, the decalcified dentine has about the\ndensity of rotten wood. With an adequate improvement in nutrition,\ntooth decay will generally be checked provided two conditions are\npresent: in the first place, there must be enough improvement in the\nquality of the saliva; and in the second, the saliva must have free\naccess to the cavity. Of course, if the decay is removed and a filling\nplaced in the cavity, the bacteria will be mechanically shut out. One\nof the most severe tests of a nutritional program, accordingly, is the\ntest of its power to check tooth decay completely, even without\nfillings. There are, however, two further tests of the sufficiency of\nimprovement of the chemical content of the saliva. If it has been\nsufficiently improved, bacterial growth will not only be inhibited, but\nthe leathery decayed dentine will become mineralized from the saliva by\na process similar to petrification. Note that this mineralized dentine\nis not vital, nor does it increase in volume and fill the cavity. When\nscraped with a steel instrument it frequently takes on a density like\nvery hard wood and occasionally takes even a glassy surface. When such\na tooth is placed in silver nitrate, the chemical does not penetrate\nthis demineralized dentine, though it does rapidly penetrate the\ndecayed dentine of a tooth extracted when decay is active. This process\nis illustrated in Fig. 96 which shows two deciduous teeth extracted\nfrom the same child, one before, and the other a few months after\nimproving the nutrition. These deciduous molars were replaced by the\nbicuspids of the second dentition. The tooth at the left had deep\ncaries and was removed before the treatment was begun. Note that the\nsilver nitrate has blackened the tissue to the depth of the decay. The\ntooth at the right was removed about three months after the nutrition\nwas changed.

This\nentirely blocked off a threatened exposure and kept the walls of the\nfort sealed against bacteria. This process does not occur in many\ninstances in people of our modern civilization. Pulp chambers that are\nopened by wear provide exposed pulp which becomes infected with\nsubsequent abscess formation. If a reinforced nutrition as efficient as\nthat of many of the primitive races, is adopted, the pulp tissue will\nseal up the opening made by decalcification of the dentine, by building\nin a new layer of normal dentine which is vital and quite unlike the\npetrified decay exposed to the saliva, thus completely walling off the\nimpending danger. This is illustrated in Fig. 97 with three cases. At\nthe left are shown x-rays of teeth of three children in one of my\nexperimental clinics in a poor district in Cleveland.

A phase of this\nhas been closely related to the slogan that a clean tooth cannot decay.\nAmong the difficulties in applying this interpretation is the physical\nimpossibility of keeping teeth bacteriologically clean in the\nenvironment of the mouth. Another difficulty is the fact that many\nprimitive races have their teeth smeared with starchy foods almost\nconstantly and make no effort whatsoever to clean their teeth. In spite\nof this they have no tooth decay. In many of the primitive groups that\nI have studied the process of modernization includes teaching oral\nhygiene and prophylaxis.

After spending some time selecting different\ninternal organs, the lion backed away and turned and pawed dirt over\nthe carcass which he abandoned to the jackals. The scientist hurried to\nthe carcass and drove away the jackals to study the dead zebra to note\nwhat tissues had been taken. This gave him the clue which when put into\npractice has entirely changed the history of the reproduction of the\ncat family in captivity. The addition of the organs to the foods of the\ncaptive animals born in the jungle supplied them with foods needed to\nmake reproduction possible. Their young, too, could reproduce\nefficiently. As I studied this matter with the director of a large lion\ncolony, he listed in detail the organs and tissues that were\nparticularly selected by animals in the wilds and also those that were\nprovided for animals reproducing in captivity. He explained that,\nwhereas the price of lions used to be fifteen hundred dollars for a\ngood specimen, they were now so plentiful that they would scarcely\nbring fifteen cents.

They further found that when the percentage\nof abnormal sperm was high a condition of sterility was apparently\nestablished. In a personal communication from Professor McKenzie he\nstates that their inference is that with a high percentage of abnormal\nsperm the ova either are not fertilized or that fertilization takes\nplace and that prenatal death occurs in a certain number of the cases,\nand that there is an appreciable prenatal death loss in sheep, horses,\ncattle, and swine. I have referred to the data presented by Mall\nindicating that 15 per cent of human conceptions in England are\nexpelled as deformities in the second and third month of gestation.\nMcKenzie also presents data relating to swine in which a sire that\nshowed a high percentage of abnormal sperm was bred to two groups of\nsows of similar breed. One was maintained in a barn without access to\npasture, the other received similar rations plus access to pasture. The\ngroup without pasture produced a high percentage of mummies, small\nlitters, and abnormal pigs (open abdominal walls with viscera\nprotruding and exposed spine in the region of the lumbar vertebrae).\nThe second group on the same food with the addition of pasturage\nproduced normally large-size litters without mummies. The following\nyear this experiment was repeated reversing the groups of sows and\nusing a similar high percentage of defective sperm in the same sire.\nThe same results occurred, with the group maintained without access to\npasture. This emphasizes the need for the vitamins and minerals that\nare provided in natural foods, particularly vitamin A and seems to\nrelate to the studies of Hale in which the absence of vitamin A\nproduced gross defects. These studies on domestic animals strongly\nemphasize the necessity that both parents shall have adequate nutrition\nbefore conception occurs and subsequently for the mother.",

Williams, who is one of\nthe few students of this problem as it relates to domestic animals, in\nreferring to this phase has commented that there is no treatise in the\nEnglish language on teratology (development of monsters) in domestic\nanimals.(16)He emphasizes that these defects\nare growing in numbers and economic importance. He refers to Burki's\nstudies in Switzerland indicating that this difficulty has constantly\nand enormously increased in his territory. This veterinary has asked\n\"Are our cows degenerating?\" It is of interest that a type of deformity\ncommonly recognized among veterinaries as a distortion of the head\npresenting a lack of development of the bones of the middle part of the\nface including the upper jaw is commonly called \"bull-dog calf.\" This\nis particularly important in connection with the frequent human\ndeficiency of lack of development in the middle third of the face.\nWilliams emphasizes the common knowledge that Boston bull-dogs are not\nprolific and because of the difficulty of giving birth to their young,\nsome veterinarians resort routinely to caesarian section. Fortunately,\nseriously deformed specimens are seldom born alive and usually do not\ncontinue to term. Williams states that Loje has observed ten grossly\ndeformed calves of a particular type that were traced to the same sire;\nalso a series of five with this deformity reported by Hutt were traced\nto one sire. Among the deformities in domestic animals cleft palate or\nabsence of palate is very common. These studies on domestic animals\nstrongly emphasize two facts; first, that deformities among these\nanimals are very similar to those that develop in humans, and second,\nthat the defects are largely related to the original germ cells and\nthat the male may provide the defect quite as well as the female.\nSeveral of the primitive races have understood and provided against\nthese mishaps.",

It argues that the consumption of whole, unprocessed foods typical in traditional diets leads to better physical development, stronger bones, and healthier facial features. In contrast, modern processed foods high in sugars, refined grains, and unhealthy fats contribute to physical degeneration and various health issues, undermining the benefits accrued from natural, nutrient-dense foods.\n\n**Korean Translation:**\n이 책은 전통적인 식단이 강한 건강과 최적의 얼굴 구조를 촉진하는 데 중요하다는 점을 강조합니다. 저자는 전통적인 식단에 포함된 전체, 가공되지 않은 식품의 섭취가 더 나은 신체 발달, 강한 뼈, 건강한 얼굴 특징으로 이어진다고 주장합니다. 반면, 현대의 가공식품은 설탕, 정제된 곡물, 건강에 해로운 지방이 많이 포함되어 있어 신체의 퇴화와 다양한 건강 문제를 초래하며, 자연적이고 영양이 풍부한 식품에서 얻은 이점을 약화시킵니다."

A\npreliminary survey of the backward children of this institution was\nmade by having typical classes selected by an official of the school\nfrom ages ranging from eleven to seventeen. I examined the arches and\nmade measurements of the head and face. With the assistance of the\nschool nurse I obtained records of the other children in the families\nselected. This latter survey was supplemented by field work by the\nnurse. The intelligence quotients, as reported in the records, were\nalso provided. In the twenty-nine individuals so studied, seven, or\ntwenty-five per cent were first children; fourteen, or fifty per cent\nlast children in the families. Only one individual was found with\napproximately normal dental arches, that is, approximately three per\ncent of the individuals. Twenty-eight children, or 97 per cent, had\nabnormality of one or both dental arches. These children were placed in\nthis institution because they were backward mentally, although as a\ngroup they are comparable to the group studied in the Thomas A. Edison\nSchool, where the grouping was based on delinquent traits. A cursory\nexamination was made by observing other pupils in this school in their\nclasses and on the grounds. A large percentage of severe facial and\ndental arch deformities and a very high percentage with definite\ndisturbances in facial growth were evident. These data are presented as\napplying to a group of individuals characterized by a disturbed\nmentality, to the extent that they were assigned to special classes for\nthe mentally retarded. While the group constituting the school\npopulation at Outwaithe represented the relatively large group of\npupils assigned to special classes for backward children and did not\ncarry the stigmata of delinquency carried by those of the Thomas A.\nEdison School, both groups had many physical defects in common.",

He has shown that the surgical removal of\nthe pituitary body at the base of the brain in very young rats produces\nregularly a certain type of defect in skull development. This has been\ncharacterized by a lack of development forward of the muzzle or face,\nwith a narrowing of the nose and dental arches. He found that by the\naddition of extracts made from the pituitary glands, which he had\nremoved surgically, he entirely prevented the development of these\ndefects, thereby establishing the relation of the injury to\ndeficiencies of the hormones developed by that organ. Another approach\nto the problem on which he has expended much fruitful effort, has been\nin connection with the study of the skulls of individuals who are known\nto have disturbances in the functioning of the pituitary gland through\nthe interference caused by tumors. Common illustrations are the cases\nof acromegaly or giantism. By associating these physical changes in\nbodily form with each x-ray, data obtained from skiagraphs, together\nwith the history and the nature of the tumor, considerable information\nhas been developed. Another important series of studies has included\nthe correlation, by means of the x-rays, of the skulls of individuals\nsuffering from certain types of physical and mental disturbances, with\ncertain abnormalities in the skull as shown by the x-rays. By these\nvarious means Dr. Mortimer has been able to divide the various types of\nskull defects and developmental and growth defects into distinct\nclassifications. With this yardstick he is able to classify individuals\nfrom their Roentgenograms. It is of interest that in his work, in\nassociation with Dr. G. Levine, Dr. A. W. Rowe and others at the Evans\nMemorial for Clinical Research and Neuro-Endocrine Research in Boston,\nimportant relationships have been established through the examination\nof over three thousand case histories. X-ray records of the skull are\nincluded in the studies.

Much\nof what we have thought of as so-called pyorrhea in which the bone is\nprogressively lost from around the teeth thus allowing them to loosen,\nconstitutes one of the most common phases of the borrowing process.\nThis tissue with its lowered defense rapidly becomes infected and we\nthink of the process largely in terms of that infection. A part of the\nlocal process includes the deposit of so-called calculus and tartar\nabout the teeth. These contain toxic substances which greatly irritate\nthe flesh starting an inflammatory reaction. Many primitive peoples not\nonly retain all of their teeth, many of them to an old age, but also\nhave a healthy flesh supporting these teeth. This has occurred in spite\nof the fact that the primitives have not had dentists to remove the\ndeposits and no means for doing so for themselves. Note particularly\nthe teeth of the Eskimos. The teeth are often worn nearly to the gum\nline and yet the gum tissue has not receded. Many of these primitive\ngroups were practically free from the affection which we have included\nin the general term of pyorrhea or gingivitis. Pyorrhea in the light of\nour newer knowledge is largely a nutritional problem. While nutrition\nalone often will not be adequate for correcting it, when established\npractically no treatment will be completely adequate without\nreinforcing the nutrition in so far as deficient nutrition has been a\ncontributing factor. Nutrition plus the frequent removal of deposits,\nplus suitable medication will check and prevent pyorrhea but not\ncorrect the damage that has already been done. The elements that are\nchiefly needed in our nutrition are those that I have outlined as being\nparticularly abundant in the menus as used by several of the primitive\nraces. These are discussed in detail in Chapter 15.",

If we think of growing plants and\ngrasses in terms of average soil tilled to a depth of seven inches, we\nare dealing with a total of approximately two million pounds of soil\nper acre, of which two thousand pounds will be phosphorus in its\nvarious chemical forms, some of which will not be readily available for\nplants. If one-half of this phosphorus were present in an available\nform, there would be enough for only one hundred poor crops, utilizing\nten pounds to the acre for the seed alone; or for forty good crops,\ntaking twenty-five pounds per acre, assuming that the seed were to be\nremoved from that land and not replaced. A sixty-bushel crop of wheat\nor corn per acre takes twenty-five to twenty-eight pounds of phosphorus\nin the seed. The soil is depleted of calcium similarly, though that\nmineral is not usually present in such limited amounts nor so rapidly\ntaken away as is phosphorus. The leaves and stems of rapidly growing\nyoung plants and grasses are rich in calcium and phosphorus. As the\nplants ripen the phosphorus is transported in large amounts to the seed\nwhile most of the calcium remains in the leaves. A large part of the\ncommerce of the world is concerned with the transportation of chemical\nelements as foods, chief of which are calcium and phosphorus. Whether\nthe product of the soil is ultimately used as wheat for bread, milk and\nmeat for foods, or wool and hides for clothing, every pound of these\nproducts that is shipped represents a depletion of soil for pasturage\nor for grain production.",

In the first place, the\nprimitive peoples have carried out programs that will produce\nphysically excellent babies. This they have achieved by a system of\ncarefully planned nutritional programs for mothers-to-be. It is\nimportant to note that they begin this process of special feeding long\nbefore conception takes place, not leaving it, as is so generally done\nuntil after the mother-to-be knows she is pregnant. In some instances\nspecial foods are given the fathers-to-be, as well as the\nmothers-to-be. Those groups of primitive racial stocks who live by the\nsea and have access to animal life from the sea, have depended largely\nupon certain types of animal life and animal products. Specifically,\nthe Eskimos, the people of the South Sea Islands, the residents of the\nislands north of Australia, the Gaelics in the Outer Hebrides, and the\ncoastal Peruvian Indians have depended upon these products for their\nreinforcement. Fish eggs have been used as part of this program in all\nof these groups. The cattle tribes of Africa, the Swiss in isolated\nhigh Alpine valleys, and the tribes living in the higher altitudes of\nAsia, including northern India, have depended upon a very high quality\nof dairy products. Among the primitive Masai in certain districts of\nAfrica, the girls were required to wait for marriage until the time of\nthe year when the cows were on the rapidly growing young grass and to\nuse the milk from these cows for a certain number of months before they\ncould be married. In several agricultural tribes in Africa the girls\nwere fed on special foods for six months before marriage. The need for\nthis type of program is abundantly borne out by recent experimental\nwork on animals, such as I have reported in Chapters 17, 18 and 19.",

Dr.\nWilliam Forest Patrick of Portland, Oregon was deeply concerned over\nthe regularly occurring rash that develops on newborn infants shortly\nafter they are first washed and groomed. He had a suspicion that Nature\nhad a way of taking care of this. In 1931 he left the original oily\nvarnish on several babies for two weeks without the ordinary washing\nand greasing. He found them completely free from the skin irritation\nand infection which accompanies modern treatment. This method was\nadopted by the Multanomah County Hospital of Oregon which now reports\nthat in 1,916 cases of unwashed, unanointed babies only two cases of\npyodermia occurred.

When I visited the\nnative Fijian Museum at Suva, I found the director well-informed with\nregard to the practices of the natives in the matter of producing\nhealthy normal children. He provided me with a shell of a species of\nspider crab which the natives use for feeding the mothers so that the\nchildren will be physically excellent and bright mentally, clearly\nindicating that they were conscious that the mother's food influenced\nboth the physical and mental capacity of the child. The care with which\nexpectant mothers were treated was unique in many of the Pacific\nIslands. For example, in one group we were informed that the mother\ntold the chief immediately when she became pregnant. The chief called a\nfeast in celebration and in honor of the new member that would come to\njoin their colony. At this feast the members of the colony pledged\nthemselves to adopt the child if its own parents should die. At this\nfeast the chief appointed one or two young men to be responsible for\ngoing to the sea from day to day to secure the special sea foods that\nexpectant mothers need to nourish the child. Recent studies on the\nvitamin content of crabs have shown that they are among the richest\nsources available.

An operation to improve her appearance consisted in\nremoving the first bicuspid on each side above and then moving the bone\ncarrying the anterior teeth backward with appliances, the width of the\ntwo removed teeth. This changed the relationship of the teeth as shown\nin the two upper views in Fig. 134. The operation greatly improved her\nfacial appearance and she lost the inferiority complex which had\nprevented her from mingling with young people. When she went to the\nhospital for her first child, there was special concern because of her\nweak heart, and every effort was made to obtain a normal birth rather\nthan one by Caesarian section. This proved impossible and the Caesarian\noperation was done. Great difficulty was experienced in saving the life\nof the mother and child. Her boyish figure, of which she had been so\nproud, and which had been a part of her serious deformity, during her\nformative period had nearly resulted in her undoing. She nursed her\nbaby for some time but the overdraft of reproduction on her frail body\nwas so great that she aged rapidly, her back weakened and she stooped\nforward as shown in Fig. 134, lower right. In the view at the lower\nleft, it will be seen that the teeth remained in their new position. A\npoint to keep in mind is that her physical deficiency was probably\ndirectly caused by an inadequate nutrition of her mother during the\nintrauterine development and prior to conception. It is, of course,\npossible that the father also contributed a poisoned germ cell that\nconstituted a disturbance in the architectural design of the offspring.\nIn this connection, it is important to have in mind the tragic\ninfluence of a program of deliberate starvation of mothers-to-be in\norder that the bones of the baby may be soft and thus provide an easy\nbirth. Some literature has been published indicating the foods that\nwould be efficient in accomplishing this. This means almost certain\nwreckage or handicapping of the child's life.",

Hear what Dr. Peter McKinley has to say on\nthe subject. \"The death rate of infants in the period immediately\nsubsequent to birth is nine times as high as that which occurs later in\nthe first years of life.\" He shows how the difficulty experienced by\nthe mothers during parturition leads to the death of infants at and\njust after birth, and says in this connection, \"Infant deaths under a\nmonth are significantly associated with the death rates of mothers in\nchildbearing.\" He quotes Netherland statistics showing that of\nstillbirths due to difficulty during birth, male stillbirths\npredominate, and says, \"These figures might be taken in support of the\nview that the greater size of the male head is a cause of some greater\ndifficulty in labour than there is with a female birth.\" Here, indeed,\nin civilized childbirth is the laboratory where the sex of the\npopulation is finally determined-the actual births of boys and girls\nare nearly equal in number, but the small ones slip through; the larger\nchildren are the ones who are killed during birth, or so damaged that\nlife is heavily handicapped, and we are left with an enormous surplus\nfemale population. This destruction of male infants, which goes on day\nby day and year by year, puts the consequences of the Great War into\nthe shade. Our surplus female population (now reaching over one and a\nhalf million in excess of the male) is directly due to it. We have no\nneed of Pharaoh's midwives to kill our boys off at birth (Exodus i.\n16). Civilization does it unaided, for all civilized races as they pass\ntheir zenith and are on the downgrade have eventually had to face the\nsame problem, the outnumbering of men by women, and most of them have\nmet it as the East does to-day by female infanticide. A more\nintelligent policy would be to prevent the males dying at birth.

A\nsufficient variety of foods must be used to supply the body's demand\nfor those elements which it needs in large quantities, that is, calcium\nand phosphorus, and the other elements which it needs in smaller\nquantities, though just as imperatively. One of the serious human\ndeficiencies is the inability to synthesize certain of the activators\nwhich include the known vitamins. This makes necessary the\nreinforcement of the nutrition with definite amounts of special foods\nto supply these organic catalysts, especially the fat-soluble\nactivators, including the known vitamins, which are particularly\ndifficult to provide in adequate quantities. I have shown that the\nprimitive races studied were dependent upon one of three sources for\nsome of these fat-soluble factors, namely, sea foods, organs of animals\nor dairy products. These are all of animal origin. I have indicated in\nChapter 16 the nutritional programs that have proved in clinical\ntesting adequate for providing the body with nutrition that will not\nonly prevent tooth decay, but check it when it is active. The stress\nperiods of life, namely, active growth in children and motherhood, do\nnot constitute overloads among most of the primitive races because the\nfactor of safety provided by them in the selection of foods is\nsufficiently high to protect them against all stresses. I have\nindicated the type of nutrition that is especially needed for these\nstress periods in our modern civilization. Also, that it is not\nnecessary to adopt the foods of any particular racial stock, but only\nto make our nutrition adequate in all its nutritive factors to the\nprimitive nutritions. Tooth decay is not only unnecessary, but an\nindication of our divergence from Nature's fundamental laws of life and\nhealth. (See Chapter 16 for primitive menus.) The responsibility of our\nmodern processed foods of commerce as contributing factors in the cause\nof tooth decay is strikingly demonstrated by the rapid development of\ntooth decay among the growing children on the Pacific Islands during\nthe time trader ships made calls for dried copra when its price was\nhigh for several months. This was paid for in 90 per cent white flour\nand refined sugar and not over 10 per cent in cloth and clothing. When\nthe price of copra reduced from $400 a ton to $4 a ton, the trader\nships stopped calling and tooth decay stopped when the people went back\nto their native diet. I saw many such individuals with teeth with open\ncavities in which the tooth decay had ceased to be active.",
